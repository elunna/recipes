Ready In: 2.5 hrs
Serves: 8 cups

Ingredients
1/2 cup hoisin sauce
1/4 cup reduced-sodium soy sauce — plus 1 tablespoon, use tamari to make gluten free
2 tablespoons rice vinegar
2 teaspoons sesame oil
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
2 pounds ground chicken breast
1 small bunch green onions — thinly sliced, white/light green and dark green parts divided
1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger
2 cloves garlic — minced (about 2 teaspoons)
8 ounces baby bella cremini mushrooms — finely chopped
1 1/2 cup grated carrots — from about 3 large carrots
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes — reduce to 1/4 teaspoon or omit if sensitive to spice
2 cans water chestnuts, drained and finely chopped — (8 ounce cans) drained and finely chopped
2 heads butter lettuce

Directions
    • Lightly coat a 5-quart or larger slow cooker with nonstick spray. 
    • In a small bowl, stir together the hoisin, soy sauce, rice vinegar, and sesame oil. Set aside.

    • Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium high. 
    • Add the chicken and brown the meat, breaking it into small pieces. 
    • Continue cooking until no longer pink, about 4 to 6 minutes. 
    • Stir in the white and light green parts of the green onions, ginger, and garlic. 
    • Cook 30 additional seconds.

    • Transfer the meat mixture to the slow cooker. 
    • Stir in the chopped mushrooms, carrots, red pepper flakes, and sauce. 
    • Cover and cook on LOW for 2 to 3 hours until the mixture is thickened and the chicken is ultra tender. 
    • (Do not be tempted to cook on HIGH, as the chicken will become tough.) 
    • Stir in the water chestnuts and green parts of the green onions.

    • To serve, separate the butter lettuce leaves and fill with the chicken mixture. 
    • Enjoy hot.
