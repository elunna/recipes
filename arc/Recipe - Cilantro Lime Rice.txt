CHIPOTLE’S CILANTRO LIME RICE

Description: I am a huge fan of the rice at Chipotle's. Here is my copycat version, it tastes just like the real thing. Of course, I used less oil. Makes a wonderful side dish for chicken, beef or pork.

Ready In:  25 min
Serves: 4

Ingredients
1 cup extra long grain rice or basmati rice
1/2 lime, juice of
2 cups water
1 tsp salt
3 tbsp fresh chopped cilantro
3 tsp vegetable oil

Directions
    • In a small heavy pot, add rice, water, 1 tsp oil and salt.
    • Boil on high until most of the water evaporates. When the water just skims the top of the rice, reduce to low and cover about 20 minutes.
    • Shut off flame and keep covered an additional 5 minute.
    • In a medium bowl, combine chopped cilantro, lime juice, rice and remaining oil and toss until completely mixed.
