# Crusty French Bread
---
Yield: 2 loaves
Prep time: 50 min

## Ingredients
- 2 cup warm water
- 1 tbsp yeast
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 2 tsp salt
- 5 - 5 1/2 cup bread flour
 
## Instructions
1. Dissolve yeast in warm water (110 degrees) and sugar in large bowl; allow yeast to proof or foam (about 10 minutes).
2. Add salt, oil, and 3 cup flour; beat for 2 minutes.
3. Stir in 2 cup flour to make a stiff dough.
4. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.
5. Place in oiled bowl, turn dough to coat all sides, cover and let rise until doubled.
6. Punch down and divide in half.
7. Shape dough into two long slender loaves.
8. Grease and sprinkle with cornmeal either a french bread pan or large cookie sheet.
9. Place loaves in pan and cut diagonal gashes on top of each loaf (I use scissors).
10. Cover and let rise until doubled.
11. Bake at 375 degrees for about 30 minutes.

Note: You can sprinkle or spray water on the loaves during baking if you want a really crunchy crust.

## Notes
"This recipe produces two crusty and chewy loaves that are so very good and so much better than store bought."

I substituted a cup of wheat flour, and let it rise a long time to get big loaves. Also used oatmeal instead of cornmeal on the baking sheet.
