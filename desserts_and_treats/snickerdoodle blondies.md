## Notes

While we love the classic blondies, when we're craving a perfect, easy fall dessert, we turn to these snickerdoodle-flavored blondies every single time. Perfectly tender and chewy (with a cinnamon-sugar topping), these blondies get that signature snickerdoodle texture and flavor without cream of tartar. We know, we know—they said it couldn't be done. But, these blondies nail that classic chewy texture and flavorful tang, no cream of tartar needed. If you're a fan of the classic cookie, trust us—you're about to meet your new favorite dessert.  

If you have any blondies, leftover store them in an airtight container at room temperate for 2-3 days.
