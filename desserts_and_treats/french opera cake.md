Prep time:

## Ingredients
For the cake:
- 85 g (3 oz) confectioners’ sugar, sifted
- 4 large eggs
- 1 tsp vanilla bean extract
- 115 g (4 oz) almond meal
- 65 g (2.3 oz) plain flour
- 2 tbsp espresso powder
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1/8 tsp fine sea salt
- 2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted
- 4 large egg whites
- 50 g (1.8 oz) caster sugar
- 1 tsp cream of tartar

## Instructions

Pre-heat the oven to 190 C (375 F). Grease and line three 15 cm (6 inch) cake pans.

In a large bowl, use an electric hand whisk to whisk together the confectioners’ sugar, eggs and vanilla until the mixture is thick and pale ribbons have begun to form. Sift in the almond meal, flour, espresso, baking powder and salt then gently fold with a rubber spatula to combine. Stir in the melted butter.

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, begin whisking the egg whites on medium speed until they begin to foam. Add in the sugar and cream of tartar in a steady stream and turn the mixer speed to high. Whisk until the mixture is glossy and stiff peaks have begun to form.

Fold in half of the egg white bowl into the other flour and butter bowl to loosen. Gently fold in the remainder of the egg whites, being careful not to over-mix.

Divide the mixture between the prepared cake pans then evenly spread out the tops with the spatula.

Bake for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the cakes spring back when lightly pressed and a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean.

Let the cakes cool in their tins for 15 minutes before inverting out onto a wire rack.

Once cool, level any domed tops and halve each layer, if desired.

For the soak:

50 g (1.8 oz) caster sugar, 2 tsp espresso powder, 60 ml (2.1 fluid oz) water, 2 tbsp coffee liqueur

Combine the sugar, espresso and water in a small saucepan.

Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the coffee liqueur. Let the syrup cool slightly before using.

For the ganache:

170 g (6 oz) dark chocolate, finely chopped, 120 ml (4.2 oz) heavy cream

Place the chocolate in a heatproof bowl.

Pour the cream into a small saucepan and bring it to a simmer over medium-low heat.

Remove from the heat and pour the hot cream all over the chocolate. Let the mixture sit for 1 minute before using a whisk to mix together until smooth and glossy. Let the ganache cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally, before using it in the recipe.

For the buttercream:

2 tsp espresso powder. 3 tbsp hot water, 6 large egg yolks, 200 g (7 oz) caster sugar, 60 ml (2.1 fluid oz) water, 2 tsp vanilla bean extract, 280 g (9.9 oz) unsalted butter, very soft at room temperature, cut into tbsp

Mix the espresso and hot water together in a small bowl until dissolved. Set aside to cool.

Place the egg yolks in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Whisk on high speed until the yolks are pale in colour and doubled in volume.

Meanwhile, place the sugar and water in a medium sized saucepan set over medium-high heat. Stir to combine. Heat the mixture until the syrup reaches 114 C (238 F) on a thermometer. Once the syrup is at temperature, remove the pan from the heat.

Set the mixer speed to medium-low then carefully pour the syrup down the sides of the mixer bowl and into the whisking yolks. Increase the speed to high and continue mixing until the outside of the bowl has cooled to room temperature.

Stop the mixer and swap out the whisk for the paddle attachment.

With the mixer speed on low, add in the vanilla. Mix to combine.

Increase the speed to medium and add in the butter, a tbsp at a time, until it is all used up.

Pour in the espresso, beat to combine and turn the mixer speed to high. Beat for about 30 more seconds, or until the buttercream is smooth, thick and fluffy. Set aside for assembly.

For the glaze:

150 g (5.3 oz) dark chocolate, finely chopped, 2 tsp vegetable oil

[b]For the dark chocolate drippy glaze:[/b]

Place the dark chocolate and oil in a medium heatproof bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water.

Heat, stirring occasionally with a rubber spatula until smooth. Remove from the heat. Let cool to room temperature before using.

For assembly:

Arrange the cake layers, cut side up, on two wire racks. Glaze the tops with the coffee syrup.

Place the first cake layer, on a stand or serving platter. Spread a generous tbsp of the ganache on top of it then set in the refrigerator or freezer to harden the ganache, about 10 minutes.

Once set, spread about 60 g (2.1 oz) or two generous tbsp, of the buttercream on top of the ganache. Sandwich with a second cake layer. Repeat this process, spreading with ganache, setting to harden in the fridge and then frosting with the buttercream until all the cake layers have been used up.

Use the remaining ganache to crumb coat the cake and refrigerate until completely set.

Once the ganache has set, thickly frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining buttercream. Let the cake chill in the refrigerator for about 1 hour.

Pour the cooled dark chocolate drippy glaze over the top of the cake then use a spatula to spread it out to the edges so that it pours down the sides.

Place the cake back in the refrigerator to set the glaze before serving then decorate as desired. You can keep the cake in the refrigerator but before serving, let it stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. The cake will keep covered for up to 3 days in the refrigerator or for up to 1 day at room temperature.
