# Bacon-Wrapped Prunes
---
Yield: 8 servings

## Ingredients
- 8 slices bacon, cut into thirds
- 24 prunes, pitted

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with foil. Wrap bacon pieces around prunes and secure with toothpicks. Bake on sheet until bacon is browned, about 15 minutes, flipping halfway through. Serve warm.


## Notes

Also known as Devils on Horseback, these sinful bacon-wrapped bites are perfect for a Halloween party hors d'oeuvre. With just two ingredients and about five minutes of prep work, they couldn't be easier to prepare either. They're best served warm, so pop them in the oven right before your guests arrive.
