## Notes

Also known as Devils on Horseback, these sinful bacon-wrapped bites are perfect for a Halloween party hors d'oeuvre. With just two ingredients and about 5 minutes of prep work, they couldn't be easier to prepare either. They're best served warm, so pop them in the oven right before your guests arrive.
