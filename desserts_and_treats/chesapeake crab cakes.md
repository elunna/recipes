# Chesapeake Crab Cakes
---
Yield: 12 servings
Prep time: 40 min

## Ingredients
- 1 large egg
- 1/4 cup mayonnaise
- 1 tsp Old Bay seasoning
- Kosher salt
- 1 lb jumbo lump crabmeat, picked over
- Coarse cornmeal, preferably stone-ground, for dusting
- 1 celery stalk, thinly sliced crosswise
- 1 mini cucumber, cut into thin rounds
- 1 lime, halved
- 1/4 cup safflower oil

## Instructions
1. In a large bowl, whisk together egg, mayonnaise, Old Bay, and 1/2 tsp salt. Fold in crabmeat to evenly coat (do not overmix). Generously dust a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet with cornmeal. Divide crab mixture evenly into 12 portions, forming each into a 2-inch-diameter, 1-inch-thick patty. Transfer to prepared baking sheet. Dust tops of crab cakes generously with cornmeal and chill in refrigerator until set, at least 1 hour and up to 1 day.

2. Stir together celery, cucumber, juice of one lime half, and a pinch of salt; set aside.

3. Heat 2 tbsp oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. When oil shimmers, add half of crab cakes and reduce heat to medium. Cook, undisturbed, until a golden-brown crust forms on bottoms of cakes, 4 to 5 minutes. Gently flip and cook until golden brown on other sides, 4 to 5 minutes more. Transfer to a platter and loosely cover with foil to keep warm. Wipe skillet clean and fry remaining cakes in remaining 2 tbsp oil.

4. Squeeze remaining lime half over crab cakes. Serve warm, topped with celery mixture.

## Notes

The crab cakes can be formed and chilled a day ahead, and can be fried up to an hour ahead; reheat them in a 250-degree oven on a baking sheet lined with a wire rack just until warmed through, 8 to 10 minutes.
