Yield: 8 servings
Prep time: 25 min

## Ingredients
1/2 cup pecans
1 package (14 to 16 oz) all-butter puff pastry, thawed
Unbleached all-purpose flour, for dusting
2 tbsp Dijon mustard
1 round wheel (about 6 inches) Brie (1 lb)
Boozy Fruit, for serving
Apple wedges and baguette slices, for serving

Boozy Fruit:
1/2 cup dried Calimyrna figs, coarsely chopped
1/2 cup dried tart California apricots, coarsely chopped
1/2 cup dried pears, coarsely chopped
1/4 cup raisins
2 cup port wine
1 cinnamon stick
Large pinch of kosher salt

## Instructions
For boozy fruit: Combine all ingredients in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil; cook, stirring occasionally, until port just starts to turn syrupy, 8 to 10 minutes. (Sauce will continue to thicken as it cools.) Let cool completely. Remove cinnamon stick and serve, or store, covered, in refrigerator up to 1 week.

1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Toast pecans on a baking sheet until darkened slightly, 10 to 12 minutes. Grind in a food processor.

2. Increase heat to 400°F. Unfold pastry on a lightly floured work surface. Sprinkle pecans evenly over half of pastry; fold over other half and pinch edges to seal.

3. Cut pastry in half crosswise; pinch cut edges to seal. Roll out one half to an 8-inch square.

4. Brush 1 tbsp Dijon on one side of Brie. Place in center of rolled-out pastry, mustard-side down. Brush remaining 1 tbsp Dijon on top of Brie.

5. Roll out remaining half of pastry to a 9-inch square. Center over brie and gently press around it to remove any air pockets. Trim pastry, leaving a 1/2-inch border around brie. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet.

6. Gather dough scraps and reroll to 1/8 inch thick. Using cookie cutters or a paring knife, cut out leaf shapes and score cutouts to create veins. Transfer cutouts to sheet with brie. Freeze until pastry is firm, about 20 minutes.

7. Brush top and sides of pastry with egg. Adhere cutouts to top of pastry in a decorative pattern, and brush cutouts with egg.

8. Bake 30 minutes. Reduce heat to 350°F and continue baking until pastry is puffed and golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes more. Serve hot, with Boozy Fruit, apple wedges, and baguette slices.

Need something easy but impressive? This baked brie with boozy fruit is just that. We use store-bought puff pastry and a streamlined technique for maximum flavor and deliciousness with minimal effort. Adding toasted ground pecans to the pastry brings another layer of taste and crunch. Freezing the pastry-covered brie allows the pastry to firm up before baking, and decorating it with leaves cut from the leftover puff pastry takes it to the next level. Serving it with our boozy fruit also elevates this favorite French appetizer. It’s a party-worthy dish that tastes as good as it looks.

Tip: If the pastry is browning too quickly, loosely cover it with foil.
