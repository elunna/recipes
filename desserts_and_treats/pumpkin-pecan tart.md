# Pumpkin-Pecan Tart
---
Yield: 1 11-inch round tart
Prep time:

## Ingredients
For the Crust
All-purpose flour, for work surface
1/2 recipe Pate Brisee for Pumpkin-Pecan Tart
1 egg white, lightly beaten

For the Filling
1 (15-oz) can pumpkin puree
1 (14-oz) can sweetened condensed milk
2 large eggs, room temperature
1 tsp ground cinnamon
Pinch of coarse salt

For the Topping
3/4 cup light-brown sugar
3 tbsp all-purpose flour
1 tsp ground cinnamon
Pinch of coarse salt
4 tbsp unsalted butter, cut into small cubes and chilled
1 1/2 cup pecan halves
Sweetened whipped cream, for serving

## Instructions
1. Make the crust: On a lightly floured work surface, roll pate brisee into a 14-inch round. With a dry pastry brush, sweep off excess flour; fit dough into an 11-inch-round tart pan with a removable bottom. Fold edges toward center to reinforce; press into sides of tart pan. Prick bottom of tart shell all over with the tines of a fork. Cover with plastic wrap; chill tart shell until firm, about 30 minutes.

2. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Uncover and line chilled tart shell with parchment and fill with pie weights or dried beans. Transfer to oven and bake until crust is set in pan, 30 to 35 minutes. Remove weights and parchment and continue baking until bottom of crust is lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool slightly. Brush crust with egg white and let stand 5 minutes.

3. Increase oven temperature to 425 degrees.

4. Make the filling: In a large bowl, whisk together pumpkin, condensed milk, eggs, cinnamon, and salt. Pour filling into cooled tart shell; transfer to oven and bake until slightly set, about 15 minutes.

5. Make the topping: Meanwhile, in a large bowl, mix together brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, and salt; using a pastry blender or your hands, mix in butter until mixture is crumbly. Add pecan halves and mix to combine.

6. Remove tart from oven and reduce temperature to 350 degrees. Sprinkle topping over filling and return tart to oven; bake until topping is dark golden-brown and center is bubbling slightly, 35 to 40 minutes. Let cool. Serve with whipped cream.

## Notes

Part pumpkin pie, part pecan pie, this recipe from Thomas Joseph combines the best of both and is the perfect holiday dessert. Martha made this recipe on "Martha Bakes" episode 403.
