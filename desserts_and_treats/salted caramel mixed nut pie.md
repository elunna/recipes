# Salted Caramel Mixed Nut Pie
---
Yield: 12
Prep time: 1 hr 30 mins

## Ingredients
Easiest Ever Pastry Dough
1 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1 Tbsp. sugar
1/2 tsp. Kosher salt
1/2 cup cold unsalted butter, cut up (1 stick)
1 Tbsp. distilled white vinegar
1 Tbsp. ice-cold water, plus 1 to 2 tsp if necessary

Sweet and Salted Caramel Nut Pie
4 cup mixed pecans, walnuts and hazelnuts, toasted
1 1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup water
3 Tbsp. light corn syrup
6 Tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
1/2 tsp. Kosher salt
1 cup heavy cream
Flaked sea salt, for serving

## Instructions
1. Make Easiest Ever Pastry Dough.

2. Make Pie: On lightly floured surface, roll dough into 13-inch circle. Fit dough into bottom and up side of 9-inch pie plate. If necessary, trim dough so overhang is even (about 1⁄2 inch from edge of rim). Fold overhang under itself and crimp as desired. Refrigerate until firm, at least 20 minutes.

3. Heat oven to 375°F. Press large piece nonstick foil into dough in pie plate and fill with pie weights. Bake 15 minutes, then remove foil and continue baking until pastry feels sandy and just starts to turn golden, 5 to 10 minutes more. Transfer to cooling rack; place nuts in crust. Reduce heat to 350°F.

4. Place sugar, water and corn syrup in heavy-bottomed medium saucepan. Without stirring, cook on medium-high until bubbles begin to form at edges, about 1 minute; swirl pan. Bring to a simmer, then increase heat to high and boil, swirling pan occasionally until mixture is a rich caramel color, 6 to 10 minutes. Immediately remove from heat, add butter and salt and swirl pan to melt.

5. Return pan to medium, add cream (it will bubble up) and whisk until smooth, slightly thickened and a deep amber color, about 1 minute. Pour caramel over nuts; transfer pie to oven. Bake until gently bubbling, 10 to 15 minutes.

6. Transfer to wire rack to cool. Sprinkle with flaked sea salt if desired.


## Notes

The unique combination of toasted pecans, walnuts and hazelnuts give this sweet pie a touch of saltiness.
