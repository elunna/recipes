# roasted sweet potatoes
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
2 medium sweet potatoes
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons clarified butter, ghee,
or coconut butter
Salt and black pepper

## Instructions
1. PREHEAT the oven to 375°F.
2. WASH the sweet potatoes thoroughly and pat dry. With
a fork or paring knife, carefully puncture all sides of each
potato. Rub the olive oil evenly over the skin.
3. WRAP each sweet potato securely in foil, sealing the foil
on top. Place on a baking sheet and roast for 30 minutes.
Starting at the 30 minute mark, insert a fork or knife into
the center of the potato every 5 minutes; they are done
when they are very soft and tender. (Depending on the size
of the potatoes, this may take up to 1 hour.)
4. REMOVE the foil and cut the sweet potatoes open length-
wise. Keeping the skin on, add 1 tablespoon of butter to
each sweet potato, scraping the flesh gently with a fork so
the butter melts into the flesh. Season to taste with salt and
pepper.


### MAKE IT A MEAL: 
This simple but delicious side goes
well with just about anything. We think it complements
Braised Beef Brisket (page 214), Grilled Coconut-Curry
Chicken (page 230), Cod with Mushroom and Red Pepper
Relish (page 242), or Pork Chops With Spiced Applesauce
(page 258). Or, stuff a roasted sweet potato with Pulled
Pork Carnitas (page 254) and top with our Avocado
Mayonnaise (page 310).

### COMPOUND BUTTER 
A compound butter (see page 181)
would be a delicious addition to this simple side dish. Some
combinations to consider: 2 teaspoons chopped rosemary
leaves and % cup chopped, toasted pecans; % teaspoon each
cinnamon and nutmeg, % cup chopped toasted walnuts,
and % cup chopped raisins; or 2 cloves minced garlic with 2
teaspoons each chopped rosemary, thyme, and sage.

## Notes

You can also slice your sweet potatoes
into long “spears” before roasting—these
are perfect for dipping! Add the spears
to a bowl with the olive oil and mix to
coat. Place the spears in one layer on
a parchment paper-lined baking sheet
and roast as directed, about 40 minutes,
until the edges are brown but not burned.
These pair well with Ranch Dressing
(page 316), Garlic Aioli (page 309), or
Sunshine Sauce (page 320).
