# cauliflower-broccoli mash
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
1 1/2 cups chicken or vegetable broth
1 head cauliflower, cut into florets
2 bunches broccoli, cut into florets
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 cup coconut milk
2 tablespoons clarified butter or ghee
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley


## Instructions
1. BRING the broth to a simmer in a saucepan over
medium-high heat. 
2. Add the cauliflower, broccoli,
garlic, and coconut milk. Cover and cook until the
florets are fork tender, 12 to 15 minutes.
3. TRANSFER the half of the florets and liquid to
a food processor. (The florets are so bulky you
need to puree in batches, so just estimate half
the contentsâ€”it will all come back together in
the end.) Blend on low speed until smooth in
consistency and transfer to a bowl. Puree the
remaining florets and liquid.
4. RETURN all the mash to the food processor and
add the clarified butter, salt, and pepper, and
pulse until well mixed. 
5. Add the parsley and con-
tinue blending on low until completely smooth.
6. YOU can make the mash up to a day before
your dinner and reheat in a saucepan on the
stove just before serving.
