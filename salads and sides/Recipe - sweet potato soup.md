# sweet potato soup
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
2 tablespoons cooking fat
2 large-diced peeled sweet potatoes
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger (or
2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger)
1 pinch ground cinnamon, plus extra
for garnish
1 cup full-fat coconut milk
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper

## Instructions
1. IN a Dutch oven or large pot, heat the cooking fat over
medium heat, swirling to coat the bottom of the pot. When
the fat is hot, add the sweet potatoes, stirring to coat them
with the fat. Add the ginger and cinnamon and stir for
15 seconds. Add 3 cups of water and the coconut milk and
bring to a boil. Simmer until the sweet potatoes become
soft, about 15 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat.
2. IN one or two batches, puree the sweet potato mixture in a
food processor or blender to a smooth consistency, or use
an immersion blender to mix it right in the pot. Return the
soup to the pot. Cook the soup to your desired thickness
over medium-low heat—the longer it simmers, the thicker
the soup will become. Season to taste with the salt and pep-
per, garnish with extra cinnamon, and serve.


### MAKE IT A MEAL: 
You could add any pre-cooked meat to
this soup and make it a complete meal—try grilled chicken,
sausage, ground beef, or scallops. Or, serve alongside our
Stuffed Peppers (page 222), Thai Cucumber Cups (page
234), or Mexican Tuna Boats (page 238).

### FRESH GINGER 
Peeling and mincing fresh ginger can
be a difficult task—watch your fingertips! First, peel the
ginger root by scraping the skin off with the edge of a spoon
or a vegetable peeler. (Don’t worry if you miss a few spots in
the corners.) From there, you can mince the ginger by hand
by cutting the root into coins, then cutting the coins into
matchsticks, then dicing the matchsticks a few times until
you have a very fine mince. Or, use a Microplane (like a mini-
cheese grater) to grate the ginger. Do this over a bowl or plate
to catch the juices as you grate.

## Notes

For a more savory soup, use 1/2 teaspoon
garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon onion
powder, and 1 tablespoon fresh thyme
leaves in place of the cinnamon, and
add some fresh sliced mushrooms when
you return the soup to the pot for the
final stage of cooking. For more of a
traditional fall flavor, use a sugar-free
apple pie spice mixture in place of the
cinnamon, add some finely diced sweet
onion and apple in the final stage of
cooking, and top with chopped pecans.
For a thinner soup, simmer for just 1 to
2 minutes, then add compliant chicken
broth one tablespoon at a time until
you reach the desired consistency.
