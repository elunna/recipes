---
Yield: 6 to 8 Serves

## Ingredients
6 cups Pressure-Cooker Black Beans
1 medium seedless cucumber, cut into ¼-inch pieces
4 ½ ounces crumbled feta (1 cup)
⅓ cup chopped cilantro, plus more for serving
3 scallions, thinly sliced
¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil
3 tablespoons fresh lime juice, plus wedges for serving
Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper

## Instructions
1. Place cooked beans, cucumber, feta, cilantro, scallions, oil, and lime juice in a large bowl. Season with 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper; toss well to combine. Top with more cilantro and serve with lime wedges.

## Notes

Pressure-cooked black beans (time to break out that Instant Pot!) meet cool cucumbers and bright cilantro, lime, and feta in this refreshing side dish that's ideal year-round. This recipe appears in our cookbook "Martha Stewart's Pressure Cooker" (Clarkson Potter).
