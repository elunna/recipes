# coconut cauliflower rice
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients

1 head cauliflower, cut into florets
2 tablespoons coconut oil, ghee, or clarified butter
1/4 onion, finely chopped
1 cup coconut milk
1/4 cup shredded coconut flakes
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 tablespoon finely chopped cilantro

## Instructions
1. TO “rice” the cauliflower florets, pulse in a food
processor until they turn into small, ricelike
pieces, 20 to 25 pulses. (You'll want to do this in
two batches. Don’t overcrowd the cauliflower in
the food processor, and don’t over-pulse or the
florets will get mushy.)
2. IN a large skillet, melt the cooking fat over
medium heat and swirl to coat the bottom of
the pan. When the fat is hot, add the onion and
cook, stirring, until translucent, 2 to 3 minutes.
3. Add the riced cauliflower and coconut milk
and mix thoroughly. Cover and steam until the
coconut milk has been absorbed by the rice and
the cauliflower is tender, about 10 minutes. (The
best way to test for doneness is to eat a bite!)
4. Scrape up any brown bits from the bottom of the
pan with a wooden spoon and mix into the rice.
5. REMOVE the pan from the heat and mix in the
shredded coconut, salt, and pepper.
6.  Gently stir
in the chopped cilantro and serve warm.
