### DON’T BE INTIMIDATED 
by lemongrass. This woody
plant with a lemony scent is a common addition to Thai
recipes. To use it, cut off the lower bulb and remove the
tough outer leaves, leaving just the yellow center. Find this
(and lots of other interesting herbs and spices) at your local
health food store or Asian market—but if you can’t find it, just
of the lime zest to the broth
add more ginger root and half
instead.

## Notes

Want more spice? De-seed and finely dice
another jalapefio and toss it in when you
add the chicken. Craving some seafood?
Use shrimp, scallops, or a firm white fish
instead. Need more greens? Add a bag
of baby spinach or a few handfuls of
zucchini noodles just as you’re pulling it
off the stove, letting them wilt in the hot
broth before garnishing and serving.
