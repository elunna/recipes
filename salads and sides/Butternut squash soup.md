# butternut squash soup
---
Yield: 2 servings

## Ingredients
3 tablespoons clarified butter, ghee,
or coconut oil
1/2 cup diced onion
3 cups diced seeded peeled butternut
squash
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
4 cups chicken broth
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper

## Instructions
1. IN a large pot, melt the cooking fat over medium heat,
swirling to coat the bottom of the pot. When the fat is hot,
add the onion and cook, stirring, until translucent, 2 to 3
minutes. Add the squash, garlic, and ginger and stir until
the garlic becomes aromatic, about 1 minute.
2. ADD the chicken broth and bring to a boil over high heat.
Boil until the butternut squash is soft, about 10 minutes.
Remove the pot from the heat.
3. IN one or two batches, transfer the soup to a food proces-
sor or blender and blend on high speed until smooth in
texture. Return the pureed soup to the pot.
4. HEAT the soup over medium-high heat until it thickens
enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon, 7 to 10 min-
utes. Season with the salt and pepper.



### MAKE IT A MEAL:
To make this a complete meal,
add cooked chicken, scallops, or hard-boiled eggs when
returning the soup to the pot for the last 7 to 10 minutes of
cooking. For extra greens, add two generous handfuls of
spinach or kale in the last 3 minutes of cooking.


### PREPPING SQUASH 
Peeling and dicing squash isn’t
that tough if you have the right technique. First, cut a small
amount off the bottom and top of the squash, to give it a flat
surface. Next, use a vegetable peeler to peel the squash from
top to bottom. Next, rest the squash on the flat bottom surface
and cut in half from top to bottom, creating two long halves.
Scoop the seeds from the middle of the squash with a large
spoon. Finally, lay the two halves flat on the cutting board
and cut strips lengthwise, then across, to create your dice. If
some pieces are much thicker than others, cut in half again,
so your cubes are alla relatively consistent size.

## Notes
Not sure how much squash to buy
for this recipe? Generally, a 2-pound
butternut squash yields 3 cups once
the seeds are removed, but don’t
stress about having slightly more
or less squash than the recipe calls
for—this one is pretty forgiving. You
can also buy pre-cut butternut squash
and save yourself the guess work and
10 minutes of prep time, but that'll
definitely add to your grocery bill.
