# thai cucumber cups
---
Yield: 2 servings

## Ingredients
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
1/2 jalapefio, seeded and minced
Grated zest and juice of 2 limes
1/2 cup + 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 cup cashews
1 cup roughly chopped button, cremini,
or portabella mushrooms
1/4 cup finely diced red, yellow, or
orange bell pepper
2 tablespoons thinly sliced green onion
1 pound ground turkey
4 cucumbers, hollowed into cups (see below)
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro


## Instructions
1. TO prepare the dressing, whisk together the garlic, ginger,
jalapefio, and lime zest and juice in a medium non-reactive
mixing bowl. Whisking, drizzle in % cup of the olive oil.
Whisk in the salt and pepper. Set aside.
2. IN a large skillet over medium-high heat, add 1 tablespoon
of the olive oil and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan.
When the fat is hot, add the cashews and toast, shaking the
pan to keep them from burning, until lightly browned, 2 to
3 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board, roughly chop, and
let cool.
3. IN the same skillet over medium-high heat, heat the
remaining tablespoon of olive oil. Add the mushrooms and
cook, stirring, for 3 minutes. Add the bell pepper, green
onion, and turkey. Cook, breaking up the turkey with a
spatula or wooden spoon and mixing it into the vegetables,
until the turkey is thoroughly browned, 7 to 10 minutes.
4. REMOVE the pan from the heat, add most of the dressing,
and mix well. Sprinkle the chopped cashews into the turkey
mixture.
5. SPOON the turkey mixture into the cucumber cups and
top with the chopped cilantro and a drizzle of the remain-
ing dressing.

### CUCUMBER CUPS 
To make the cucumber cups, cut each
cucumber into 3 logs (approximately 2 inches long). Scoop
out the inner flesh using a small spoon or small melon baller,
but don’t scoop out all the way through to the bottom, as the
cups need to hold the meat mixture. Lightly salt the cucumber
rounds and place on paper towels to drain.

## Notes

The cucumber cups make this dish the
perfect appetizer, pot-luck contribution, or
baby shower dish, but they may be too time-
consuming for a mid-day lunch. The turkey,
vegetable, and dressing mixture is just as
tasty over a bed of crisp greens, wrapped
in a romaine lettuce leaf, scooped into a bell
pepper, or spooned on top of any of our
breadless bun options on page 173-174.
It’s also delicious reheated in the morning
(and topped with a fried egg or two).
