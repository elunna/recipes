Description: I am a huge fan of the rice at Chipotle's. Here is my copycat version, it tastes just like the real thing. Of course, I used less oil. Makes a wonderful side dish for chicken, beef or pork.

## Ingredients
1 cup extra long grain rice or basmati rice
1/2 lime, juice of
2 cups water
1 tsp salt
3 tbsp fresh chopped cilantro
3 tsp vegetable oil

## Instructions
1. In a small heavy pot, add rice, water, 1 tsp oil and salt.
2. Boil on high until most of the water evaporates. When the water just skims the top of the rice, reduce to low and cover about 20 minutes.
3. Shut off flame and keep covered an additional 5 minute.
4. In a medium bowl, combine chopped cilantro, lime juice, rice and remaining oil and toss until completely mixed.
