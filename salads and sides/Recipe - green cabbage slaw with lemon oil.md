### MAKE IT A MEAL:
This crisp, fresh dish goes well with just
about anything. It’s a great partner to the warmth of a Perfect
Grilled Steak (page 154), is light enough to complement our
Poached Salmon with Cucumber Dill Sauce (page 246), and
is a cool companion for our Chimichurri Beef Kabobs (page
218). Or top it with cooked (cold) shrimp, salmon, chicken, or
hard-boiled eggs to make ita complete meal.

### SHREDDING CABBAGE 
Shredding cabbage is really
fast and easy if you have the right technique. First, cut the
cabbage in half, then in half again. Take each quarter and
remove the core of the cabbage (the thick white stem) by
cutting it out with a sharp knife. Lay each quarter ona flat
side and cut crosswise into thin slices, working from top to
bottom. You'll end up with thin ribbons of cabbage, perfect for
slaw. (Shredding carrots is easy too—just use the largest holes
in your cheese grater until your carrot is down to a sliver!)

## Notes

save time and use 4 cups of packaged
shredded cabbage, or use 2 cups of
packaged shredded cabbage mixed with
2 cups broccoli slaw. Adding a thinly
sliced Granny Smith apple would also
give the slaw a bite of tartness. A mayo-
based dressing would contribute a bit
more creaminess—just replace the olive
oil with 1/4 cup Basic Mayonnaise (page
179). Finally, for a fun variation, make
a spicy slaw! Instead of lemon oil, mix
the slaw with a dressing of 1/4 cup apple
cider vinegar, 1/4 cup Whole30 Ketchup
(page 323), and 1 teaspoon hot sauce
(see page 403).
