# Vegan Lentil Soup
---
Yield: 4 servings
Prep time: 20 min

## Ingredients
2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling
½ cup chopped shallot
½ cup chopped carrot
½ cup chopped celery
½ teaspoon ground cumin
½ teaspoon ground coriander
Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
1 cup dried French lentils
1 can (15 ounces) crushed tomatoes
4 cups chopped broccoli rabe
2 teaspoons red-wine vinegar

## Instructions
1. Heat oil in a pot over medium-high. Add shallot, carrot, celery, cumin, coriander, and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring, until vegetables have softened, 4 to 6 minutes.
2. Stir in lentils, tomatoes, and 4 1/2 cups water. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, partially covered, until lentils are tender, 40 to 45 minutes.
3. Stir in broccoli rabe (if soup is too thick, add up to 1/2 cup water); cook until tender, about 3 minutes more. Stir in red-wine vinegar, season with salt and pepper, and serve, with more pepper and a drizzle of oil.

## Notes
Tender broccoli rabe adds a welcome pop of green (and a generous dose of fiber!) to this lentil-and-tomato soup spiced with coriander and cumin.
