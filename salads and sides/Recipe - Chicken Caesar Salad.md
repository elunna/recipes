Description: This timeless chicken Caesar salad features a zesty dressing made with Greek-style yogurt. Our dressing calls for anchovy paste, which adds that signature savory flavor Caesar salad is known for. Any leftover anchovy paste can be used to enhance vinaigrettes, dips or sauces. You can use whole anchovies, if you prefer, but you’ll need to blend them or mash them with the flat side of a large chef’s knife before adding them to the dressing.
