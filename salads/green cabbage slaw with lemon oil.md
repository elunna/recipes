---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- Juice of 1 lemon
- 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 medium head green cabbage, finely shredded

- 2 tbsp chopped cashews
- 1 tsp sesame seeds
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1 tbsp ribbon-chopped fresh basil

## Instructions

2. While whisking, slowly add the olive oil in a steady stream until fully blended.

### MAKE IT A MEAL:
This crisp, fresh dish goes well with just about anything.
- Perfect Grilled Steak
- Poached Salmon with Cucumber Dill Sauce,
- Chimichurri Beef Kabobs.
- Or top it with cooked (cold) shrimp, salmon, chicken, or hard-boiled eggs to make it a complete meal.

### SHREDDING CABBAGE 
Shredding cabbage is really fast and easy if you have the right technique. First, cut the cabbage in half, then in half again. Take each quarter and remove the core of the cabbage (the thick white stem) by cutting it out with a sharp knife. Lay each quarter on a flat side and cut crosswise into thin slices, working from top to bottom. You'll end up with thin ribbons of cabbage, perfect for slaw. (Shredding carrots is easy too—just use the largest holes in your cheese grater until your carrot is down to a sliver!)

## Notes
- Save time and use 4 cup of packaged shredded cabbage, or use 2 cup of packaged shredded cabbage mixed with 2 cup broccoli slaw.
- Adding a thinly sliced Granny Smith apple would also give the slaw a bite of tartness.
- A mayo-based dressing would contribute a bit more creaminess—just replace the olive oil with 1/4 cup Basic Mayonnaise.
- Finally, for a fun variation, make a spicy slaw! Instead of lemon oil, mix the slaw with a dressing of 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar, 1/4 cup Whole30 Ketchup, and 1 tsp hot sauce.
