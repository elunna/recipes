# Tuna Salad in Avocado Boats
---
Yield: 2-3 servings
Prep time:

## Ingredients

2 cans of wild tuna
2â€“3 tbsp of mayo 
1 tbsp dijon or spicy mustard
4 tbsp chopped onion
1/4 cup chopped carrot
1/4 cup chopped celery
1/2 tsp black pepper
Dill to taste
3 ripe avocados

## Instructions

1. Open the tuna up, drain excess liquid.
2. Add the tuna to a medium bowl or tupperware of choice (I use tupperware when I am prepping this so I only dirty one dish)
3. Add the mayo and black pepper and mix well with your fork (I usually mash it down with the fork)
4. Fold in the celery, carrots and onions and mix well
5. Cut the avocados in half and remove the pit (you can also shallow out the avocado and add some chunks to the tuna salad!)
6. Add desired amount of tuna to the avocado and enjoy!



## Notes
Store in the fridge; stays good for 3-4 days


* Can also sub the avocado for a toasted piece of sourdough, a bagel or english muffin.
* You can also serve it over a bed of greens in a salad and with some crackers on the side for crunch.
