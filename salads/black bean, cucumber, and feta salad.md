---
Yield: 6 to 8 Serves

## Ingredients
- 6 cup Pressure-Cooker Black Beans
- 1 medium seedless cucumber, cut into 1/4-inch pieces
- 4 1/2 oz crumbled feta (1 cup)
- 1/3 cup chopped cilantro, plus more for serving
- 3 scallions, thinly sliced
- 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 3 tbsp fresh lime juice, plus wedges for serving
- Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper

## Instructions

## Notes

Pressure-cooked black beans (time to break out that Instant Pot!) meet cool cucumbers and bright cilantro, lime, and feta in this refreshing side dish that's ideal year-round. This recipe appears in our cookbook "Martha Stewart's Pressure Cooker" (Clarkson Potter).
