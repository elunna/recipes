# Fennel Grapefruit Cilantro Salad
---
Yield: 4 servings
Prep time: 15 mins

## Ingredients
- 1 large grapefruit (or 2-3 oranges)
- 1 small fennel bulb, cored and thinly sliced, plus fennel fronds for garnish
- 1 medium Granny Smith apple, cored and thinly sliced
- 1 tbsp toasted sunflower seeds
- 1/2 cup cilantro, chopped
- Apple Cider Vinaigrette (or other)

## Instructions
1. Zest grapefruit into a large bowl until you have 1 tbsp zest.
2. Cut the grapefruit into segments. Cut the segments into thirds;
3. Squeeze 2 tbsp juice from the leftover membranes into the large bowl with the zest.
4. Add fennel, apple, and the reserved grapefruit to the bowl and toss until combined. Sprinkle with
sunflower seeds. Garnish with fennel fronds, if desired.

## Notes

This quick and colorful side salad is a lovely accompaniment to fish, chicken, or pork. When slicing the
fennel, don't discard the fronds! The wispy green tips resemble fresh dill and provide a colorful, anise-
flavored garnish.
