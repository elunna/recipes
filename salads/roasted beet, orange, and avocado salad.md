# roasted beet, orange, and avocado salad
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
2 medium beets
2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
1 orange, halved, one half zested and
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp black pepper
1 avocado, split lengthwise, pitted,
peeled, and diced

## Instructions
1. PREHEAT the oven to 425°F.
2. RINSE the beets thoroughly and carefully stab all sides
with a fork. Place in a medium bowl and add 1 tbsp
of the olive oil, tossing or mixing to thoroughly coat. Wrap
the oiled beets in aluminum foil, pinching the top closed to
create a seal. Place the beets in the center of a baking sheet
and roast for 35 minutes. Check them by carefully opening
the foil and sticking a thin knife into the center of a beet:
If it goes in easily, the beets are done. If there’s resistance,
close them back up and put back into the oven for 10
minutes. Repeat until the knife slides into the center of the
beet easily. Let rest until cool enough to handle.


3. REMOVE the skin from the beets—you may want to wear
gloves and an apron, as beet juice will stain your skin and
clothes. Dice the beets into l-inch pieces and place ina
serving bowl.

4. IN a small bowl, combine the remaining 1 tbsp olive
oil with the vinegar, orange juice, salt, and pepper and
whisk until combined.
5. ADD the orange segments and avocado to the beets.
Drizzle with the dressing, sprinkle on the orange zest, toss
to coat, and serve.
6. MAKE IT A MEAL: This fresh salad tastes great in all
seasons. Serve with Perfect Whole Roasted Chicken (page
157), Beef Brisket (page 214), or Halibut with Citrus-Ginger
Glaze (page 240).

## Notes

If you’re planning to double this recipe
for leftovers, double everything but
the avocado. The dressed beets and
orange slices will hold up well in the
fridge for a day or two, but avocado
tends to turn brown and mushy. Your
best bet is to add a fresh avocado to
your leftovers right before serving.
We also love adding delicate greens
such as pea shoots or frisée to give
the salad a little added texture.
