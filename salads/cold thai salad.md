# cold thai salad
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
- 2 small zucchini
- 1 small cucumber
- 2 carrots, peeled and shredded
- 1/2 cup mung bean sprouts (optional)
- 1/4 cup chopped cashews
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
- 1/2 cup Sunshine Sauce

## Instructions
1. Peel the zucchini with a regular peeler. Then, using a julienne peeler, make long slices along one side of one zucchini, until you get down to the seeded core. Rotate the zucchini and continue to peel until you’ve done all four sides. Repeat the process with the remaining zucchini and the cucumber. You should have about 2 cup of “noodles.” (If you have a spiral slicer, you can use that instead of a julienne peeler.) Discard the cores.
2. Place the zucchini and cucumber noodles in a medium mixing bowl.
3. Add the shredded carrots, bean sprouts if using, most of the chopped cashews, and most of the cilantro.
4. Chill for 30 minutes.
5. Add a tbsp (or more) of water to the Sunshine Sauce to thin it out to the consistency of a creamy dressing and
pour over the chilled salad, stirring well to combine.
6. Garnish with the remaining cashews and cilantro and serve.

### MAKE IT A MEAL:
- Add cooked shrimp, chicken, or hard-boiled eggs to the salad before chilling to make it a complete meal.
- Or serve alongside Halibut with Citrus-Ginger Glaze, Thai Cucumber cup with Turkey, or Chimichurri Beef Kabobs.

### THAI SOUP
You could easily turn this cold dish into a hot soup:
1. Heat 4 cup of beef or chicken broth in a large pot.
2. While that’s warming, place a small skillet over medium heat and add the cashews.
3. Toast them in the pan, shaking often, until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes.
4. Remove the cashews trom the pan and set aside.
5. Once the broth is warm, add the zucchini, carrots, and bean sprouts to the pot and allow to soften, 2 to 3 minutes.
6. Transfer to individual serving bowls, add the toasted cashews, and top with the fresh cilantro.
7. Serve alongside sliced cucumbers and Sunshine Sauce for dipping.

## Notes
Skip the 30 minutes of chill time by placing the zucchini, cucumber, carrots, and bean sprouts in the fridge the night before you prepare this dish — or just skip it altogether, if you don’t mind your salad at room temperature.

If you feel like a lighter dressing, try tossing the vegetables with our Asian Vinaigrette or the creamy Cilantro-Lime Mayonnaise instead of the Sunshine Sauce.
