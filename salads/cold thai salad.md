# cold thai salad
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
2 small zucchini
1 small cucumber
2 carrots, peeled and shredded
1/2 cup mung bean sprouts (optional)
1/4 cup chopped cashews
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1/2 cup Sunshine Sauce (page 320)

## Instructions
1. PEEL the zucchini with a regular peeler. Then, using a
julienne peeler, make long slices along one side of one
zucchini, until you get down to the seeded core. Rotate the
zucchini and continue to peel until you’ve done all four
sides. Repeat the process with the remaining zucchini and
the cucumber. You should have about 2 cups of “noodles.”
(If you have a spiral slicer, you can use that instead of a
julienne peeler.) Discard the cores.
2. PLACE the zucchini and cucumber noodles in a medium
mixing bowl. Add the shredded carrots, bean sprouts if
using, most of the chopped cashews, and most of the cilan-
tro. Chill for 30 minutes.
3. ADD a tablespoon (or more) of water to the Sunshine Sauce
to thin it out to the consistency of a creamy dressing and
pour over the chilled salad, stirring well to combine. Garnish
with the remaining cashews and cilantro and serve.

### MAKE IT A MEAL:
Add cooked shrimp, chicken, or hard-
eed eggs to the salad before chilling to make it a complete
meal. Or serve alongside Halibut with Citrus-Ginger Glaze
(page 240), Thai Cucumber Cups with Turkey (page 234), or
Chimichurri Beef Kabobs (page 218).

### THAI SOUP
You could easily turn this cold dish into a
hot soup. Heat 4 cups of beef or chicken broth in a large pot.
While that’s warming, place a small skillet over medium heat
and add the cashews. Toast them in the pan, shaking often,
until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Remove the cashews
trom the pan and set aside. Once the broth is warm, add the
zucchini, carrots, and bean sprouts to the pot and allow to
soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to individual serving bowls,
add the toasted cashews, and top with the fresh cilantro.
Serve alongside sliced cucumbers and Sunshine Sauce for
dipping.

## Notes

Skip the 30 minutes of chill time by
placing the zucchini, cucumber, carrots,
and bean sprouts in the fridge the night
before you prepare this dish—or just
skip it altogether, if you don’t mind
your salad at room temperature. If
you feel like a lighter dressing, try
tossing the vegetables with our Asian
Vinaigrette (page 330) or the creamy
Cilantro-Lime Mayonnaise (page
310) instead of the Sunshine Sauce.
