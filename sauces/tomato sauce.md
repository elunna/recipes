# tomato sauce
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
- 1 tbsp cooking fat
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 2 celery stalks, finely chopped
- 1 carrot, peeled and finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 can (28 oz) crushed tomatoes
- 1 tsp fresh thyme
- 1 tsp fresh oregano
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp black pepper

## Instructions
1. HEAT the cooking fat in a large pot over medium heat.
When the fat is hot, add the onion, celery, and carrot and
cook, stirring, until the onion becomes translucent,
2 to 3 minutes. Add the garlic and stir until aromatic,
about 1 minute. Add the tomatoes, thyme, oregano, bay
leaf, salt, and pepper.
2. REDUCE the heat to a simmer, cover, and cook over low
heat, stirring every 20 minutes, until the sauce is thick and
smooth, about 1 hour. Discard the bay leaf.
3. STORE in the refrigerator for up to 5 to 7 days.

### SAUCE STORAGE
If you plan to freeze the sauce, canned
tomatoes will actually taste better. The sauce will keep in
the freezer for 3 to 4 months, but because ice crystals will get
inside the sauce, just a word of warning—it may come out
runnier than it went in. You can always thicken it up again by
adding another can of tomatoes while it’s reheating.

## Notes

If you’re serving this sauce fresh, you can
substitute about 6 fresh tomatoes for the
canned. You can also quickly turn this
into a meat sauce: Just add 1 lb
of leftover Perfect Ground Meat (page
152) and 1 cup of beef broth in the
last ten minutes of simmering. Serve
over Roasted Spaghetti Squash (page
294), steamed zucchini noodles (see
page 244), or a pile of wilted spinach
for a quick, easy, complete meal.
