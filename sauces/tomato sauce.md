# tomato sauce
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
- 1 tbsp cooking fat
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 2 celery stalks, finely chopped
- 1 carrot, peeled and finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 can (28 oz) crushed tomatoes
- 1 tsp fresh thyme
- 1 tsp fresh oregano
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp black pepper

## Instructions
1. Heat the cooking fat in a large pot over medium heat.
2. When the fat is hot, add the onion, celery, and carrot and cook, stirring, until the onion becomes translucent, 2 to 3 minutes.
3. Add the garlic and stir until aromatic, about 1 minute.
4. Add the tomatoes, thyme, oregano, bay leaf, salt, and pepper.
5. Reduce the heat to a simmer, cover, and cook over low heat, stirring every 20 minutes, until the sauce is thick and smooth, about 1 hour.
6. Discard the bay leaf.
7. Store in the refrigerator for up to 5 to 7 days.

### SAUCE STORAGE
If you plan to freeze the sauce, canned tomatoes will actually taste better. The sauce will keep in the freezer for 3 to 4 months, but because ice crystals will get inside the sauce, just a word of warning—it may come out runnier than it went in. You can always thicken it up again by adding another can of tomatoes while it’s reheating.

## Notes
If you’re serving this sauce fresh, you can substitute about 6 fresh tomatoes for the canned. You can also quickly turn this into a meat sauce: Just add 1 lb of leftover Perfect Ground Meat and 1 cup of beef broth in the last ten minutes of simmering. Serve over Roasted Spaghetti Squash, steamed zucchini noodles, or a pile of wilted spinach for a quick, easy, complete meal.
