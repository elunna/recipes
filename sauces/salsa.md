- 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
- 1/2 onion, finely diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 jalapeno, finely diced
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- Grated zest and juice of 1/2 lime

## Instructions

2. Serve immediately, or allow the flavors to come together in the refrigerator for 1 to 3 hours.

## Notes
Salsa is a great replacement for ketchup, and livens up just about any ingredient.
- It’s great on Perfect Scrambled Eggs,
- as a topping for a Perfect Seared Chicken Breast or a Perfect Burger,
- or as a dip for raw celery, carrots, and jicama sticks.
- It’s also a natural match for our Guacamole.
