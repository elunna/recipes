Yield: 

## Ingredients
- 6 tomatoes, cored, seeded, and diced
- 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
- 1/2 onion, finely diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 jalapeno, finely diced
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- Grated zest and juice of 1/2 lime

## Instructions
1. MIX all the ingredients together in a small bowl and stir
gently to combine. Serve immediately, or allow the flavors
to come together in the refrigerator for 1 to 3 hours.
2. STORE your salsa in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.

QUICK PREP A vegetable chopper would cut your prep
time in half, and ensure all of your dice were the same size.
You can find them at any kitchen store, or on Amazon—
they’re generally between $12 and $30. You could use a food
processor to carefully pulse each ingredient one at a time, but
don’t combine them all at once, or you'll end up with a bowl of
mushy salsa.

## Notes

Salsa is a great replacement for ketchup,
and livens up just about any ingredient.
It’s great on Perfect Scrambled Eggs
(page 150), as a topping for a Perfect
Seared Chicken Breast (page 157)
or a Perfect Burger (page 153), or
as a dip for raw celery, carrots, and
jicama sticks. It’s also a natural match
for our Guacamole (page 308).
