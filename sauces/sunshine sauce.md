Yield: 1 cup

## Ingredients
- 1/2 cup unsweetened sunflower seed butter (or almond butter)
- 1/2 cup coconut milk
- Juice of 1 lime
- 1 tbsp coconut aminos (optional)
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes
- 1/2 tsp rice vinegar or apple
- cider vinegar

## Instructions
1. MIX all the ingredients together in a small bowl and stir to
combine. 
2. Store in an air-tight container in the refrigerator
for up to 3 days.

### COCONUT AMINOS
Coconut aminos are a soy sauce
substitute made from the fermented sap of the coconut
tree. It tastes remarkably like soy sauce, and can open up a
whole new world of Asian-inspired cooking. Many smaller
health food stores carry coconut aminos, but you can also
buy them online through Amazon or other retailers. They’re
not necessary for the Sunshine Sauce, but we think they’re so
versatile they’re worth the £8 investment. (We even bring a
bottle with us to our favorite sushi restaurant!)

## Notes

adapted from Well Fed, by Melissa Joulwan

This dip (a universal favorite of
Whole30ers everywhere) is fantastic
with fresh, raw vegetables (carrots, bell
peppers, celery, or broccoli), drizzled
over roasted vegetables (carrots,
parsnips, sweet potatoes), as a sauce
for our Perfect Seared Chicken Breast
(page157), and as a dressing for our
Cold Thai Salad (page 274) and Green
Cabbage Slaw (page 282). If you can’t
find compliant sunflower seed butter,
you can use almond butter instead.
