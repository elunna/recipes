# chimichurri
---
Yield: 2 1/2 cup

## Ingredients
- 1/4 cup red wine vinegar
- 1/4 cup lime juice
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 shallot, minced
- 1 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 1/4 cup fresh cilantro
- 1/4 cup fresh parsley leaves
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper

## Instructions
1. COMBINE the vinegar, lime juice, garlic, and shallot in a
food processor and mix on low speed. Drizzle in the olive
oil while mixing; the dressing will begin to emulsify. Add
the cilantro, parsley, salt, and pepper and continue to mix
on low until the dressing is uniform in texture and the herb
pieces are chopped quite small.
2. CHIMICHURRI will last 2 to 3 days in the refrigerator. If
making ahead, bring it to room temperature before serving.
If the dressing has separated, gently whisk to reblend.


### STORING CHIMICHURRI
If you make a big batch of
chimichurri, you can freeze portions in ice cube trays. That
makes it easy to pop out just what you need for your next
meal or recipe. Spoon the chimichurri into the trays (donâ€™t
over-fill), then cover the top tightly with plastic wrap. When
the sauce is frozen, remove the plastic wrap, pop out the
cubes, and transfer them to a resealable plastic bag. These
will keep for up to 6 months in the freezer, and each cube is
about 1 oz.

## Notes

Versatile chimichurri is a great topping
for steak, lamb chops, chicken, and
eggs, and is fantastic drizzled over
grilled vegetables. You can also use
it to marinate meat (like a flat-iron
or skirt steak) before grilling.
