# Curry Sauce
---
Yield: 2 cup
Prep time: 30 min

## Ingredients
- 1 tbsp cooking fat
- 1/2 onion, diced
- 1 1/2 tsp minced fresh ginger
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 1/2 tsp yellow curry powder
- 1/2 tsp red curry powder (or cayenne pepper for spice)
- 2 cup full-fat coconut milk
- grated zest and juice of 1/2 lime
- 1/2 tsp salt
- pinch of pepper

## Instructions
1. Heat the cooking fat in a medium skillet over medium heat. When the fta is hot, add onion and cook until translucent, 2-3 min. Add the ginger nd cook for 1 min, stirring quickly. Add garlic and cook for ~1 min while continuing to stir.
2. Add both cury powders and stir quickly for 30 sec to open up the flavor of the spices. Once fragrant, add the coconut milk. Turn the heat down to low and allow the mix to simmer (not boil) until the mix thickens a bit, 8-10 minutes. (It will continue to thicken as it cools) Season with the lime zest and juice, salt, and pepper.
3. Keep warm and serve right away, or let the flavors develop further in the fridge. Keeps ~5 days.

### CITRUS ZEST 
You'll notice that many recipes in this book
use citrus zest. Don’t skip this step! Zest (the colored part
of the peel) from lemon, lime, grapefruit, or orange adds an
abundance of flavor to your dish, makes for an attractive
garnish, and contains even more micronutrients than the
juice. You won't regret investing in a good zester—they’re
inexpensive, and will save you precious time in the kitchen.
However, you can get the same effect by rubbing your citrus
over the small holes of a grater or Microplane; or using
a vegetable peeler, then chopping your zest finely with a
knife. When zesting, make sure you only remove the brightly
colored skin, and don’t peel all the way down into the bitter
white pith.


## Notes

(Note, the coconut milk will solidify in the cold, so pull it
out of the fridge and let it come back to room temperature
before serving.)


Like your curry on the hotter side?
Substitute 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
for the red curry powder, or simply
add the same amount of cayenne
along with the curry powder. This
sauce is delicious on salmon, white
fish, chicken, and roasted vegetables.
