# whole30 ketchup
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
- 1 cup tomato paste
- 1/2 cup apple cider
- 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/8 tsp ground cloves (optional)

## Instructions
1. Heat a medium saucepan over medium heat.
2. Add the tomato paste, apple cider, and vinegar. Stir completely and let it come to a simmer, but do not allow to boil.
3. Add the garlic powder, salt, and cloves and cook, stirring frequently to prevent scorching—you may need to turn the heat down to low or simmer here.
4. Simmer until the ketchup has thickened enough to evenly coat the back of a spoon, 5 to 8 minutes.
5. Remove from the heat and allow to cool.
6. Serve when cool, or store refrigerated in an air-tight container; itll keep for up to 2 weeks.

## Notes
Don’t expect the familiar “Heinz 57” from this recipe—grocery store ketchup is thick and sweet thanks to sugar—nearly 4 g per tbsp. In fact, Heinz 57 uses both high-fructose corn syrup and corn syrup to sweeten their paste. We could use date paste to make our ketchup sugary, but that’s not really in line with the spirit of the Whole30. This ketchup will have more of a lighter vinegar flavor, different but still delicious on eggs, burgers, and baked potato “fries.”
