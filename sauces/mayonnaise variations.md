# mayonnaise variations
---
Yield: 

## garlic aioli
- 1 cup Basic Mayonnaise
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- Juice of 1/2 lemon

1. Mix all the ingredients in a small bowl] until fully incorporated.

- To make the aioli even more flavorful, **roast the garlic** before adding it to the mayo.
- This is the perfect dipping sauce for raw or roasted vegetables.
- You can also mix it into a Protein Salad or Cauliflower Mash, or thin it a bit to make a creamy dressing for our Greek Salad.

## wasabi mayonnaise
- 1 1/2 tbsp wasabi powder
- 1 cup Basic Mayonnaise

1. Mix the wasabi powder and 1 1/2 tbsp of water together in a small bowl until it forms a firm paste. (If it’s too dry, add a little more water.)
2. Mix the wasabi paste and the mayo in a small bowl until fully blended.
3. Add more of the wasabi mixture if you like it spicier, but note that wasabi takes 5 to 10 minutes to “activate” — so wait and taste-test before adding more.

Wasabi mayo is a great topping for salmon, tuna, and other fish, a nice binder for tuna or potato salad, a tasty dipping sauce for baked “fries,” and a nice drizzle for our Grilled Asparagus with Lemon Zest.

## cilantro-lime mayonnaise
- 3/4 cup Basic Mayonnaise (replacing the lemon juice with lime juice)
- 1/4 cup minced fresh cilantro
- 1 clove garlic, minced

1. Combine all ingredients in a bowl and mix well.

### Notes
This variation is used in our Steak Salad, and also works well with shrimp and scallops, as a dipping sauce for raw or roasted vegetables, and atop the Perfect Burger. You can also use it as a creamy dressing for our Cold Thai Salad.

## Avocado Mayonnaise
- 1 avocado, split lengthwise, pitted, and peeled
- 1/2 cup Basic Mayonnaise
- Juice of 1/2 lime

1. In a small bowl or food processor, mash the avocado with a fork, potato masher, or immersion blender; or mix in the food processor on low.
2. Add the mayo and lime juice and mix or blend until fully incorporated.

### Notes
- If you want a smooth, creamy texture, use a food processor or immersion blender.
- If you want it chunky, use a fork to mash and mix.
- This makes a great binder for tuna, salmon, chicken, or egg salad, a delicious dipping sauce for raw and roasted vegetables, and a creamy topping for a Mexican-inspired Perfect Ground Meat.

## herb mayonnaise
- 1 cup Basic Mayonnaise
- 2 tbsp minced mixed herbs
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- Juice of 1/2 lemon
- 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper

1. Combine all the ingredients in a bowl and mix well.

### Notes
- Try a mix of fresh herbs (we like rosemary, basil, thyme, parsley, and chives) and use the mayo to top a Perfect Chicken Breast
or to mix into tuna, salmon, or egg salad.
- Also a great topping for our Roasted Sweet Potatoes.
- Or, add a little water and shake it up to create a creamy salad dressing.

## roasted red pepper mayonnaise
- 3/4 cup Basic Mayonnaise
- 1/4 cup Roasted Red Pepper Sauce

1. Mix the mayo and sauce together in a small bowl until fully incorporated.

### Notes
This is a great way to change up a leftover dressing or sauce. This variation would be delicious on a Perfect Burger, Perfect Grilled Steak, over Perfect Scrambled Eggs, and as a dipping sauce for raw or roasted vegetables.

## tartar sauce
- 1 cup Basic Mayonnaise
- 2 tbsp minced fresh dill leaves
- 1 tbsp minced dill pickles
- 2 tsp minced chives
- Juice of 1/2 lemon
- 1/4 tsp black pepper

1. Combine all ingredients in a small bowl and mix until blended.

### Notes
Tartar sauce is traditionally served with fish (like Perfect Oven-Baked Salmon), but it’s also delicious mixed into a Protein Salad or served as a dip for roasted sweet potato spears.
