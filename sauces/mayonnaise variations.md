# mayonnaise variations
---
Yield: 

## garlic aioli
1 cup Basic Mayonnaise (page 179)
2 cloves garlic, minced
Juice of 1/2 lemon


To make the aioli even more flavorful, roast the
garlic before adding it to the mayo (see the tip
on page 322). This is the perfect dipping sauce
for raw or roasted vegetables. You can also mix
it into a Protein Salad (page 161) or Cauliflower
Mash (page 270), or thin it a bit to make a creamy
dressing for our Greek Salad (page 278).

MIX all the ingredients in a small bowl] until
fully incorporated.


## wasabi mayonnaise
1 1/2 tbsp wasabi powder
1 cup Basic Mayonnaise (page 179)

Wasabi mayo is a great topping for salmon,
tuna, and other fish, a nice binder for tuna or
potato salad, a tasty dipping sauce for baked
“fries,” and a nice drizzle for our Grilled
Asparagus with Lemon Zest (page 284).

MIX the wasabi powder and 1% tbsp
of water together in a small bowl until it forms
a firm paste. (If it’s too dry, add a little more
water.) Mix the wasabi paste and the mayo ina
small bowl until fully blended. Add more of the
wasabi mixture if you like it spicier, but note
that wasabi takes 5 to 10 minutes to “activate”—
so wait and taste-test before adding more.


## cilantro-lime mayonnaise
3/4 cup Basic Mayonnaise (page 179, replacing
the lemon juice with lime juice)
1/4 cup minced fresh cilantro
1 clove garlic, minced



COMBINE all ingredients in a bowl and mix
well.

### Notes
This variation is used in our Steak Salad (page
220), and also works well with shrimp and
scallops, as a dipping sauce for raw or roasted
vegetables, and atop the Perfect Burger (page
153). You can also use it as a creamy dressing
for our Cold Thai Salad (page 274).


## avocado mayonnaise
1 avocado, split lengthwise, pitted, and peeled
1/2 cup Basic Mayonnaise (page 179)
Juice of 1/2 lime




IN a small bowl or food processor, mash the
avocado with a fork, potato masher, or immer-
sion blender; or mix in the food processor on
low. Add the mayo and lime juice and mix or
blend until fully incorporated.

### Notes
If you want a smooth, creamy texture, use a food
processor or immersion blender. If you want it
chunky, use a fork to mash and mix. This makes
a great binder for tuna, salmon, chicken, or egg
salad, a delicious dipping sauce for raw and roasted
vegetables, and a creamy topping for a Mexican-
inspired Perfect Ground Meat (page 152).



















## herb mayonnaise

1 cup Basic Mayonnaise (page 179)
2 tbsp minced mixed herbs
1 clove garlic, minced
Juice of 1/2 lemon
1/8 tsp cayenne pepper



COMBINE all the ingredients in a bowl and
mix well.

### Notes


Try a mix of fresh herbs (we like rosemary,
basil, thyme, parsley, and chives) and use the
mayo to top a Perfect Chicken Breast (page 157)
or to mix into tuna, salmon, or egg salad. It’d
also be a great topping for our Roasted Sweet
Potatoes (page 296). Or, add a little water and
shake it up to create a creamy salad dressing.






## roasted red pepper mayonnaise
3/4 cup Basic Mayonnaise (page 179)
1/4 cup Roasted Red Pepper Sauce (page 316)




MIX the mayo and sauce together in a small
bowl until fully incorporated.

### Notes
This is a great way to change up a leftover
dressing or sauce. This variation would be
delicious on a Perfect Burger (page 153),
Perfect Grilled Steak (page 154), over Perfect
Scrambled Eggs (page 150), and as a dipping
sauce for raw or roasted vegetables.

## tartar sauce
1 cup Basic Mayonnaise (page 179)
2 tbsp minced fresh dill leaves
1 tbsp minced dill pickles
2 tsp minced chives
Juice of 1/2 lemon
1/4 tsp black pepper

COMBINE all ingredients in a small bowl and
mix until blended.


### Notes

Tartar sauce is traditionally served with fish
(like our Perfect Oven-Baked Salmon on page
160), but it’s also delicious mixed into a Protein
Salad (page 161) or served as a dip for roasted
sweet potato spears (see page 296).
