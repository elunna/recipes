# Romesco Sauce
---
Yield: 2 cup
Prep time: 25min

## Ingredients
- 2 tbsp cooking oil
- 1/2 cup almonds, chopped
- 1 small onion, diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp chili powder
- 1 tsp paprika
- 2 tomatoes, seeded and chopped
- 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive olive
- 1 1/2 tsp red wine vinegar
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper



## Instructions
- Melt the cooking fat in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
- When the fat is hot, add the almonds and toast for 3 min, stirring often.
- Add the onion and cook, stirring, for 2 min.
- Add the garlic and cook until aromatic, ~1 min.
- Add chili powder and paprika and cook until the flavors open up, ~30 sec.
- Finally, add the tomatoes, mix into the ingredients, and cook, stirring to bring up the tasty bits from the bottom of the pan, until the tomatoes are warmed through, ~2 min.

Transfer the sauce mix to a food processor. Add the rest of the ingredients and blend on low until smooth, then pour into a serving dish or glass storage container. Allow to cool before refrigerating; keeps for up to 5 days.


## Notes

Romesco is a traditional garlicky nut-and-red pepper-based sauce that originated in Spain, but we're giving it a twist by using tomatoes instead of peppers. This sauce pairs perfectly without Garlic Shrimp and Zucchini Noodles, or serve with grilled meat or fish; over roasted cauliflower, broccoli, or Brussels sprouts, or as a burger spread.
