# Buffalo Sauce
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
- 1/2 cup coconut oil
- 1/2 cup ghee or clarified butter
- 1 cup hot sauce
- 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar
- 1 clove garlic, minced

## Instructions
1. In a small saucepan, gently melt the coconut oil and ghee over medium-low heat until completely liquefied.
2. Combine the hot sauce, vinegar, and garlic in a medium mixing bowl and whisk until thoroughly blended.
3. While whisking, drizzle in the melted coconut oil and ghee. The sauce should have a smooth, consistent texture.
4. Store this sauce in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 7 days. (Note, the coconut oil and ghee will solidify in the cold, so pull it out of the fridge, let it come back to room temperature before serving, and gently stir to reblend.)

### BUFFALO WINGS 
For the perfect buffalo wings, fire up the grill!
1. Preheat the grill to medium-high heat (400°F).
2. Add 1 lb  of wings to the grill and close the lid.
3. Turning the wings every few minutes, cook until lightly charred and the skin starts to bubble, 15-20 minutes.
4. Toss the wings with the buffalo sauce in a large bowl immediately after removing them from the grill.
5. Then let them sit in the sauce for a few minutes before serving with a side of celery and carrots and our Ranch Dressing.

(You can also preheat the oven to 375°F and, following the same technique, have golden, crispy wings in about an hour.)

## Notes
Want to kick your heat up a notch?
- Add 1/4 tsp cayenne to the mix — more if you’re feeling feisty.
- You can also mix the buffalo sauce into ground beef for a spicy twist on a burger.
- Top with a fried egg, some avocado, and a little more of the sauce mixture.
