---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
- 1/2 cup walnuts
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 cup packed fresh basil leaves
- 1 cup spinach leaves
- Juice of 1/2 lemon
- 1 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper

## Instructions
1. Heat a dry skillet over medium-high heat.
2. When the pan is hot, add the walnuts in a single layer and stir or shake frequently until lightly browned, about 2 minutes.
3. Combine the walnuts and garlic in a food processor and pulse a few times to combine.
4. Add the basil and spinach and pulse until coarsely chopped.
5. Add the lemon juice.
6. While mixing on low speed, add the olive oil in a slow stream until all the ingredients are fully blended.
7. Add the salt and pepper and pulse a few more times to combine.
8. Store in the refrigerator for up to 2 to 3 days, or freeze in ice cube trays.

### PESTO NUTS
Traditional pesto uses pine nuts, but these can be expensive. We’ve used walnuts instead, but free to substitute whatever nuts you have on hand—pecans or almonds would work just as well.

## Notes
- Use this pesto in place of tomato sauce; try it mixed in with our Italian-inspired Perfect Ground Meat, or drizzled over Stuffed Peppers.
- Another one of our favorite “ingredient” meals is to make Roasted Spaghetti Squash, add sun-dried tomatoes and Whole30-compliant sausage or chicken sausage, and top with pesto and a sprinkle of pine nuts.
- It’s also delicious on eggs, or mixed into your favorite Protein Salad.
