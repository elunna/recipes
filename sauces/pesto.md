# pesto
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
- 1/2 cup walnuts
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 3 cup packed fresh basil leaves
- 1 cup spinach leaves
- Juice of 1/2 lemon
- 1 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper

## Instructions
1. HEAT a dry skillet over medium-high heat. When the pan
is hot (sprinkle some water on the dry pan—if it sizzles,
it’s hot), add the walnuts in a single layer and stir or shake
frequently until lightly browned, about 2 minutes.
2. COMBINE the walnuts and garlic in a food processor and
pulse a few times to combine. Add the basil and spinach
and pulse until coarsely chopped. Add the lemon juice.
While mixing on low speed, add the olive oil in a slow
stream until all the ingredients are fully blended. Add the
salt and pepper and pulse a few more times to combine.
3. STORE in the refrigerator for up to 2 to 3 days, or freeze in
ice cube trays (see technique on page 306).


### PESTO NUTS
Traditional pesto uses pine nuts, but these
can be expensive. We’ve used walnuts instead, but free
to substitute whatever nuts you have on hand—pecans or
almonds would work just as well.

## Notes

Use this pesto in place of tomato sauce;
try it mixed in with our Italian-inspired
Perfect Ground Meat (page 152), or
drizzled over Stuffed Peppers (page
222). Another one of our favorite
“ingredient” meals is to make Roasted
Spaghetti Squash (page 294), add sun-
dried tomatoes and Whole30-compliant
sausage or chicken sausage, and top
with pesto and a sprinkle of pine nuts.
It’s also delicious on eggs, or mixed into
your favorite Protein Salad (page 161).
