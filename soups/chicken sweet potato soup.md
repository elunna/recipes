Prep time: 10 min

## Ingredients
- 2 tbsp oil
- 4 boneless skinless chicken thighs cut into bite-sized pieces
- 1 yellow onion diced
- 1 generous pinch salt
- 2 tsp freshly grated ginger
- 2 minced garlic cloves
- 1 tsp ground turmeric
- 1/4 tsp allspice
- 1 sweet potato sliced
- 2 cup fire-roasted diced tomatoes
- 2 cup water
- 1 cup coconut milk
- 3 stalks fresh lemongrass or 1/2 tsp lemongrass paste
- 2 cinnamon sticks
- 1/4 cup white miso
- Fresh cilantro for garnish

## Instructions
1. Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until browned, 2-4 minutes. Transfer to a plate. 
2. Add the onion and salt. Cook 2-3 minutes, or until softened but not browned. Stir in the ginger, garlic, turmeric, and allspice and cook 1 minute.
3. Stir in the potatoes, tomatoes, coconut milk and 2 cup of water. Return the chicken to the pot and add the cinnamon sticks and lemongrass. Bring to a boil then reduce heat and simmer 10-15 minutes, or until the potatoes are soft.
4. Remove the lemongrass stalks (if using) and cinnamon sticks from the pot and discard them.
5. Whisk in the miso. Cook 1-2 minutes, until heated through.
6. Garnish with fresh cilantro.


### About lemongrass
Recipes that call for lemongrass can stress me out because I never know if I’ll be able to find it when I need it. It can be pretty hit or miss at the grocery store! I lucked out this time and found a huge bundle of fresh lemongrass at the local farmers market for $3. Score! I used what I needed for this chicken sweet potato soup and then froze the rest. I should have more than enough to last me through the winter.

If you aren’t so lucky, you can sometimes find small blister packs of lemongrass in the produce section, near other spices like rosemary or fresh sage. I’ve also had really good luck using lemongrass paste, which is a little easier to find. Gourmet Garden has a nice one that’s sold in tubes in the produce section – you can freeze it for longterm storage.  You can also find shelf-stable lemongrass paste (affiliate link) on Amazon, but it can be a little pricier. 

## Notes

Cozy up to a nourishing bowl of soup this fall! Coconut milk and miso make this chicken sweet potato soup recipe extra rich and creamy while warm spices like cinnamon and turmeric give it tons of flavor!
