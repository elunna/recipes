# Creamy Potato and Leek Soup with EVOO Drizzle
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
5 medium russet potatoes about 6 cups when diced
2 large leeks about 3 cups when sliced
3 cloves garlic
3 tbsp Fresh Press Farms Olive Oil plus more for serving
5 cups chicken or vegetable broth
1 cup compatible coconut milk
1-2 bay leaves
1/2 tsp dried thyme
1 tsp salt
1 tsp pepper
Fresh chives for garnish

## Instructions
1. WASH peel, and dice the potatoes. Cut off the roots and dark green parts of the leeks and set them aside, then slice and wash the white and light green parts of the leeks. Mince the garlic.
2. HEAT the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the leeks and saute for about 7-8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened. Add the garlic and saute for another 2-3 minutes.
3. POUR in the broth. Add the diced potatoes, thyme, and bay leaves, and stir. Bring to a simmer and allow it to cook for about 20 minutes, until the potatoes are fork tender. Turn off the burner. Remove the bay leaves and stir in the coconut milk.
4. USE an immersion blender to blend the soup until it’s creamy, making it as smooth or chunky as you like! Season to taste with salt and pepper.
5. SERVE the soup in bowls, and drizzle each serving with more olive oil and sprinkle with a little pepper and minced chives.

## Notes

This Creamy Potato and Leek Soup with EVOO Drizzle is cozy and hearty but not heavy or overly filling. The leeks give a mild onion flavor to the potato soup, and the olive oil drizzle adds a delicious richness to the finished dish. It’s equally perfect for busy weeknights and special holiday meals. Serve it with roasted chicken, pork tenderloin, turkey, steak, or any main dish to make it a complete meal!

This soup is completed with a beautiful extra-virgin olive oil drizzle – and you know extra-virgin olive oil is a staple in all sorts of Whole30 recipes… It’s incredibly versatile, delicious on everything, and famous for being rich in important healthy fats. The extra-virgin olive oil in this dish, from Fresh Press Farms, is even more impressive than your average oil because it’s grown, cold pressed, and bottled onsite at Fresh Press Farms in Georgia. Plus, they are the only 100% vertically integrated oil producer in the USA!
