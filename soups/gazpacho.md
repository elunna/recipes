# gazpacho
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
- 1 medium cucumber, peeled and roughly chopped
- 2 medium tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and roughly chopped
- 1 red bell pepper, seeded, ribs removed, and roughly chopped
- 1/2 small onion, roughly chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 1/2 cups canned crushed tomatoes
- 1 1/2 teaspoons red wine vinegar
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper

## Instructions
1. PULSE the cucumber in a food processor until finely
chopped. Transfer to a bowl. Repeat this process with the
chopped tomatoes, bell pepper, and onion, adding each
item to the same bowl after chopping. (If you try to blend
all the ingredients at once, they will mush instead of chop.)
Stir in the garlic and return the contents of the bowl to the
food processor.
2. ADD the crushed tomatoes, vinegar, olive oil, salt, and
pepper to the food processor and blend until you achieve a
smooth consistency.
3. REFRIGERATE the gazpacho for at least 30 minutes
before serving—overnight is even better, as the flavors will
continue to develop.


### MAKE IT A MEAL:
A MEAL: You can make this a complete meal by
adding cooked shrimp and sliced avocado to the soup just
before serving. Gazpacho also tastes great with a Kitchen
Sink Scrambled Eggs (page 202), Mexican Tuna Boats
(page 238), and Chicken Meatballs (page 226).

## Notes

If you don’t have a food processor,
you can chop each of these ingredients
by hand, and then use a blender or
immersion blender to mix the chopped
ingredients with the tomatoes, vinegar,
and olive oil. If you have some kind
of vegetable chopper, that would
make this job even quicker. (See page
140 for our recommendations.)
