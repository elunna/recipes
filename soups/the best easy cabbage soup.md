## Notes

This low carb cabbage soup recipe comes together in just about a half hour. It’s a flavorful way to warm up on a chilly day – or freeze it for later! It’s vegetarian and gluten-free as written, but you can make it your own by adding meat or beans.

Of course, you can always doctor it up depending on what you’re in the mood for or if you have any other vegetables hanging around the fridge that need to get used up. It’s great with green beans, peas, or even some kale.

You can also add a can of chickpeas or white beans to up the protein and make this a complete meal. Or brown some ground beef along with the onions for a hearty “unstuffed cabbage roll” soup. Cabbage soup with sausage is also fantastic!
