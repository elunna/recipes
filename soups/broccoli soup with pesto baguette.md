2. Boil the broth with the cream and thyme in a saucepan. Peel and cut the potatoes into about 1 cm pieces and place in the saucepan. Cut broccoli into smaller pieces and place in the saucepan. Cook for about 10 minutes, or until the potato is soft. Mix the soup smoothly. Taste with salt and pepper.

4. Cut the tomatoes and mozzarella into slices. Spread the pesto on the breads and place on tomatoes and mozzarella. Top with a little salt and pepper.

## Notes

Broccoli soup is a classic for a reason. The kids also like this right, even though it is a useful vegetable that is the main ingredient. This is served together with a pesto baguette topped with tomato and mozzarella, which also does not go off for hacks.

Tip: Season the soup with mortar fennel seeds or a little curry. If you have any old onion or soft carrot in the fridge, chop it down too and cook with it!

Also try seasoning with oregano and terragon.

Add some Sambal Oleka and some chopped garlic while cooking.

Top the soup with truffle oil and smetana.
