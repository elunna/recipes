# Vegan Lentil Soup
---
Yield: 4 servings
Prep time: 20 min

## Ingredients
- 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling
- 1/2 cup chopped shallot
- 1/2 cup chopped carrot
- 1/2 cup chopped celery
- 1/2 tsp ground cumin
- 1/2 tsp ground coriander
- Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
- 1 cup dried French lentils
- 1 can (15 oz) crushed tomatoes
- 4 cup chopped broccoli rabe
- 2 tsp red-wine vinegar

## Instructions
1. Heat oil in a pot over medium-high. Add shallot, carrot, celery, cumin, coriander, and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring, until vegetables have softened, 4 to 6 minutes.
2. Stir in lentils, tomatoes, and 4 1/2 cup water. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, partially covered, until lentils are tender, 40 to 45 minutes.
3. Stir in broccoli rabe (if soup is too thick, add up to 1/2 cup water); cook until tender, about 3 minutes more. Stir in red-wine vinegar, season with salt and pepper, and serve, with more pepper and a drizzle of oil.

## Notes
Tender broccoli rabe adds a welcome pop of green (and a generous dose of fiber!) to this lentil-and-tomato soup spiced with coriander and cumin.
