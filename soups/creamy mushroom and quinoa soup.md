### Cooking with quinoa
Quinoa is great in everything from soups like this one. You can also use it as a base for grain bowls, a filling for stuffed mushrooms or peppers, or even as a gluten-free breading for chicken fingers! If you haven’t tried it yet, I highly recommend it.

While often used as a grain, quinoa is actually a seed from a plan native to Peru. It’s related to beets, chard, and spinach — but it definitely doesn’t taste like any of them!

Quinoa is a good source of protein, iron, and fiber, and is often called a superfood for its robust nutritional profile.

In nature, quinoa seeds are coated with bitter substances called saponins. These help keep the plant safe by deterring animals from eating them as well as protecting them from bacteria, fungi, and viruses.

Removing saponins from quinoa
These saponins are extremely bitter and can leave you with an upset stomach. Luckily, they can be removed easily by rinsing the quinoa well before you cook it.

To remove the saponins, add the quinoa to a fine mesh colander and place it under running water. Swish the quinoa around to help loosen it up and ensure the water flows between each seed. It will look foamy and cloudy at first, but once the quinoa is thoroughly rinsed, the water will be clear.

A lot of commercial quinoa these days is sold pre-rinsed, but it never hurts to give it a good rinse just in case. I accidentally bought unrinsed quinoa once and didn’t rinse it myself — trust me, I’ll never make that mistake again!
