# Chicken Cauliflower Rice Soup
---
Yield: 6 servings
Prep time: 30 min

## Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons Ghee or olive oil
- 1 small Onion chopped
- 2 Carrots peeled and diced
- 2 stalks Celery diced
- Salt and Pepper
- 1 teaspoon Fresh Thyme
- 4 cups Chicken Stock or broth
- 1 Bay Leaf
- 1 Boneless Skinless Chicken Breast
- 2 cups Cauliflower Rice
- 2 cups Canned Coconut Milk full fat
- 1/4 cup Fresh Flat-Leaf Parsley

## Instructions
1. Melt the ghee in a large soup pot. Add the onion, carrot, and celery. Cook for 5-8 minutes, or until the vegetables begin to soften. Season with salt and pepper and stir in the thyme.
2. Pour in the chicken stock and add the bay leaf. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a low simmer. Add the whole chicken breast. Cover and simmer 15 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.
3. Remove the chicken from the pot and use two forks to separate it into shreds. Discard the bay leaf.
4. Return the shredded chicken to the pot, along with the cauliflower rice. Simmer 5 minutes, until the cauliflower is cooked. Stir in the coconut milk and parsley and cook until warmed through. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

## Notes

Chicken cauliflower rice soup is a comforting soup that is perfect for rainy spring days. Plus, it’s Whole30 compliant!

If you aren’t concerned with keeping the recipe paleo, you can also go the more traditional route of stirring a tablespoon of flour into the vegetables before adding the broth and swapping the coconut milk out for dairy milk.
