## Notes
Chicken cauliflower rice soup is a comforting soup that is perfect for rainy spring days. Plus, it’s Whole30 compliant!

If you aren’t concerned with keeping the recipe paleo, you can also go the more traditional route of stirring a tbsp of flour into the vegetables before adding the broth and swapping the coconut milk out for dairy milk.
