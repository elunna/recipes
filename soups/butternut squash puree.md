---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
- 3 tablespoons clarified butter or ghee
- 3 pounds butternut squash, peeled, seeded, and cut into large dice (6 cups)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 cup coconut milk
- 2 cups chicken broth
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper

## Instructions
1. MELT the butter in a Dutch oven or large pot
over medium heat. 
2. Add the squash, stirring to
coat with the fat. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring
once or twice, allowing the squash to begin to
brown. 
3. Add the garlic and stir until aromatic,
about 1 minute.
4.  Add the coconut milk and
chicken broth. Increase the heat to high and
bring to a boil. 
5. Reduce the heat to medium and
cook until the squash is fork-tender, 10 to 15
minutes.
6. TRANSFER the squash to a food processor and
blend on low speed until smooth. If necessary,
add more chicken broth or coconut milk to
reach a smooth consistency. Season with the salt
and pepper.
