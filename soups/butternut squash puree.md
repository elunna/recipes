---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
- 3 tbsp clarified butter or ghee
- 3 lb butternut squash, peeled, seeded, and cut into large dice (6 cup)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 cup coconut milk
- 2 cup chicken broth
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper

## Instructions
1. Melt the butter in a Dutch oven or large pot over medium heat. 
2. Add the squash, stirring to coat with the fat.
3. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring once or twice, allowing the squash to begin to brown. 
4. Add the garlic and stir until aromatic, about 1 minute.
5. Add the coconut milk and chicken broth. Increase the heat to high and bring to a boil. 
6. Reduce the heat to medium and cook until the squash is fork-tender, 10 to 15 minutes.
7. Transfer the squash to a food processor and blend on low speed until smooth. If necessary, add more chicken broth or coconut milk to reach a smooth consistency.
