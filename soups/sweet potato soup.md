# sweet potato soup
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
- 2 tbsp cooking fat
- 2 large-diced peeled sweet potatoes
- 1/2 tsp ground ginger (or
- 2 tbsp minced fresh ginger)
- 1 pinch ground cinnamon, plus extra for garnish
- 1 cup full-fat coconut milk
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper

## Instructions
1. In a Dutch oven or large pot, heat the cooking fat over medium heat, swirling to coat the bottom of the pot.
2. When the fat is hot, add the sweet potatoes, stirring to coat them with the fat.
3. Add the ginger and cinnamon and stir for 15 seconds.
4. Add 3 cup of water and the coconut milk and bring to a boil.
5. Simmer until the sweet potatoes become soft, about 15 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat.
6. In one or two batches, puree the sweet potato mixture in a food processor or blender to a smooth consistency, or use an immersion blender to mix it right in the pot.
7. Return the soup to the pot. Cook the soup to your desired thickness over medium-low heatâ€”the longer it simmers, the thicker the soup will become.
8. Season to taste with the salt and pepper, garnish with extra cinnamon, and serve.


### MAKE IT A MEAL: 
You could add any pre-cooked meat to this soup and make it a complete meal:
- try grilled chicken, sausage, ground beef, or scallops.
- Or, serve alongside our Stuffed Peppers, Thai Cucumber cup, or Mexican Tuna Boats.

## Notes
**For a more savory soup**, use 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp onion powder, and 1 tbsp fresh thyme leaves in place of the cinnamon, and add some fresh sliced mushrooms when you return the soup to the pot for the
final stage of cooking.

**For more of a traditional fall flavor**, use a sugar-free apple pie spice mixture in place of the cinnamon, add some finely diced sweet onion and apple in the final stage of cooking, and top with chopped pecans.

**For a thinner soup**, simmer for just 1 to 2 minutes, then add compliant chicken broth one tbsp at a time until you reach the desired consistency.
