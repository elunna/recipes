# Instant Pot Chicken Tortilla Soup
---
Yield: 6 servings
Prep time: 30 min

## Ingredients
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 4 corn tortillas cut into thin strips
- 1 onion diced
- 4 garlic cloves minced
- 1 red bell pepper diced
- 2 jalapeno peppers minced
- 1 lb boneless skinless chicken thighs or breasts
- 4 cup chicken stock
- 1/2 cup uncooked white rice
- 1 can (14.5 oz) black beans, drained
- 1 can (14.5 oz) fire roasted diced tomatoes, drained
- 2 tsp chili powder
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- 2 limes juiced
- For garnish optional: shredded Monterrey jack cheese, cilantro, sour cream, avocado

## Instructions
1. Heat the oil using the saute function of your instant pot. When the oil is hot, add half of the tortilla strips. Cook 4-5 minutes, or until golden brown. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the tortillas to a paper towel. Sprinkle generously with coarse salt.
2. Add the onions and garlic to the pot and saute 2-3 minutes, or until softened. Add the peppers and cook another 3-4 minutes. Add the chicken, uncooked tortilla strips, stock, rice, beans, tomatoes, chili powder, and oregano. Lock on the lid, making sure the vent is set to sealing, and cook on high pressure for 12 minutes.
3. Carefully remove the lid. Shred the chicken. Stir in the lime juice and season to taste with salt.
4. To serve top the soup with the crispy tortilla strips and any other garnishes that you desire.

## Notes

I like my soup topped with tortilla strips, shredded cheese, and cilantro. You can also add sliced avocado or sour cream if you like.
