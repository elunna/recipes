Yield: 

## Ingredients
2 medium sweet potatoes, peeled and
large-diced
4 cups cold water
4 tablespoons clarified butter or ghee
1/2 cup coconut milk
1 onion, finely chopped
2 stalks celery, finely chopped
1 carrot, peeled and finely chopped
1 pound ground meat (beef, lamb, bison)
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1 sprig fresh thyme leaves (or
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme)
2 teaspoons fresh oregano leaves
(or 1/2 teaspoon dried)


## Instructions
1. PREHEAT the oven to 375°F.
2. IN a large pot, place the sweet potatoes in the cold water
and bring to a boil. Boil until the potatoes are fork-tender,
about 10 minutes.
3.  Drain the water from the pot, add
2 tablespoons of the butter and the coconut milk (away
from the heat). 
4. Mash the potatoes with a potato masher,
large kitchen fork, or immersion blender, or blend them in
a food processor for a creamier texture. Transfer the pota-toes to a bowl and set aside.
5. RETURN the same pot to the stove on medium heat, and
melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter. 
6. Add the onions,
celery, and carrots and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes. 
7. Add the
ground meat and garlic. Cook, stirring often, until the meat
is browned, 7 to 10 minutes. 
8. Season with the salt, pepper,
thyme leaves, and oregano. Remove from the heat and let
the meat and veggies cool in the pot for 5 minutes.
9. SPOON the meat and vegetable mixture evenly over the
bottom of a casserole dish or 9x12-inch glass baking dish.
Carefully spread the mashed sweet potatoes over the top
of the meat and vegetable mixture. 
10. Roast in the oven for
30 minutes, letting the top brown slightly. Cut into slices
and serve.





MOVE YOUR OVEN RACK up one slot from the middle
position to create more of a golden-brown crust on the
mashed potatoes. Want to really fancy it up? Use the tines of
a fork to press a design into your sweet potato before cooking.

## Notes

For a lighter dish, use Mashed Cauliflower
(page 270) instead of sweet potato for
the top layer. You can also use mashed
white potatoes for a more traditional
feel. Crumble some crispy prosciutto or
Whole30-compliant bacon (see page 404)
over the top, or serve with our Whole30
Ketchup (page 323) for a kid-friendly
meal. This dish freezes and reheats beauti-
fully, so consider doubling the recipe,
making one to eat and one to freeze.
