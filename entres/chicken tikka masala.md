## Notes

"This recipe appeared in the Chicago Tribune on 4/17/02. The dish has turned out to be extremely popular but be advised that it's very spicy when the recipe proportions are adhered to. Unless you want a super-hot dish, I recommend cutting back on the ground red pepper in the marinade. It may also be a good idea to remove the seeds and veins from the jalapeño chile in the sauce."
