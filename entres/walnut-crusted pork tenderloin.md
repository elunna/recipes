---
Yield: 2 servings

## Ingredients
- 1 lb pork tenderloin
- 2 tbsp mustard powder
- 1 tbsp paprika
- 1 tbsp onion powder
- 1 tbsp garlic powder
- 1 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1/2 cup chopped walnuts
- 3 cup salad greens
- 1/2 cup Balsamic Vinaigrette

## Instructions
1. Remove the pork from the refrigerator approximately 30 minutes before cooking.
2. Preheat the oven to 375°F.
3. If necessary, trim the pork tenderloin, removing the tough outer skin. (This is generally not necessary on boneless cuts of pork loin, but see the tip below for details.)
4. Pat the tenderloin dry with a paper towel.
5. Mix the mustard powder, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a small bowl.
6. Rub the pork evenly with the spice mixture.
7. In a food processor or by hand, pulse or chop the walnuts until finely chopped.
8. Coat the pork evenly with 3/4 of the chopped walnuts.
9. Place the tenderloin in a baking pan and roast for 25 to 30 minutes, until the internal temperature reaches 145°F.
10. Let the pork rest for 10 minutes.
11. Slice the tenderloin into 1/2-inch-thick medallions.
12. Place the salad greens on plates, top with the pork slices, sprinkle the remaining chopped walnuts, and drizzle with the Balsamic Vinaigrette.

### REMOVING PORK LOIN’S TOUGH OUTER MEMBRANE
Most boneless cuts of tenderloin won’t have much “silver skin” (the tough membrane covering the top of a pork loin). However, if yours does, you'll want to remove it before cooking — otherwise it dries out in the oven and turns quite tough. With a sharp paring or boning knife, pinch the meat to pull the membrane away from the muscle. Remove the outer skin by sliding the knife blade just beneath the membrane and slowly cut along the muscle (with the grain of the meat) in smooth sawing motions. You can also ask your butcher to do this for you before he or she wraps up your purchase.

## Notes
Pork tenderloin is one of the leanest and most tender cuts of pork, but it’s also easy to overcook and dry out. It’s best to rely on your meat thermometer and not the clock for this cut — so watch your temperatures carefully.  This recipe would work just as well with pork chops; the cooking time in the oven would be about the same.
