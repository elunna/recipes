# chimichurri beef kabobs
---
Yield: 2 servings

## Ingredients
- 1 lb lean steak (sirloin, strip, flank), cut into 1-inch dice
- 1/2 cup Chimichurri
- 1 red, yellow or orange bell pepper, seeded, ribs removed, and cut into 1 1/2" squares
- 1 onion, cut into 6 wedges
- 1 zucchini, cut into 1 1/2-inch-thick rounds

## Instructions
1. If using wooden skewers, soak them in water for 30-60 minutes to prevent them from burning.
2. Place the steak in a resealable plastic bag or nonreactive bowl with a lid. Cover the steak with enough chimichurri (about 1 cup) to coat thoroughly. Seal the bag or cover the bowl and marinate the steak in the refrigerator for 1 to 8 hours; more is better, especially for tougher cuts. (Feel free to leave your steak marinating overnight.)
3. Remove the steak from the refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking.
4. Preheat the grill to high heat (500°F).
5. Remove the steak from the marinade; discard the marinade.
6. Prepare the kabobs by threading the steak, bell pepper, onion, and zucchini onto soaked wooden skewers or metal skewers, alternating meat and vegetables. You should be able to make about 6 skewers.
7. Grill the kabobs directly over high heat for 2 minutes on each side. Reduce the heat to medium (or move the kabobs to indirect heat). Grill to desired doneness, 12 to 15 minutes, and serve with the remaining chimichuri. (The easiest way to check is to remove one of the kebabs from the heat and cut into the meat, checking for color.)

## Notes
### MARINATING
Don’t marinate in a bowl made of copper, cast iron, aluminum, or easily stained plastic. When you add high-acid foods like citrus juice or tomato sauce to these kinds of bowls, they can react with the metal and impart a metallic taste to your foods. Instead, use a nonreactive bowl like glass or stainless steel. Always marinate in the fridge to avoid bacteria growth, and make sure to discard any remaining marinade, since it’s been in contact with raw meat.

If you don’t have a grill, you have two other options for the kabobs. First, buy a grill plate for your stove and follow the same directions — it’s just like a barbecue, minus the mosquitoes. Or, you can broil, and then bake the skewers: Preheat the oven to Broil (or 500°F) and place the skewers on a foil-lined baking sheet.  Broil the kabobs for 3 minutes, then flip the skewers and broil for another 3 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350°F and brush the skewers with the remaining chimichurri. Bake to desired doneness, 12 to 15 minutes.
