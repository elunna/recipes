# pork chops with spiced applesauce
---
Yield: 2 servings

## Ingredients
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 2 bone-in pork chops (about 1 lb total)
- 3 tbsp cooking fat
- 1 onion, sliced
- 2 apples, peeled, cored and diced
- 1/2 cup apple cider
- 1/2 tsp ground ginger
- 1/2 tsp allspice
- 1 pinch nutmeg
- 2 generous handfuls frisée

## Instructions
1. PREHEAT the oven to 350°F.
2. MIX the salt and pepper in a small bowl and use to season
both sides of the pork chops.
3. MELT 2 tbsp of the cooking fat in a large skillet
over medium-high heat. When the fat is hot, add the pork
chops and sear until you see a golden brown crust, 2 to 3
minutes. Turn and sear the other side for 2 minutes.
4. TRANSFER the pork chops to a baking dish and roast in
the oven until the internal temperature reaches 140°F,
10 to 15 minutes, depending on thickness.
5. WHILE the pork is roasting, combine the remaining
1 tbsp fat and the onion in the same skillet. Cook
over medium heat until the onion is translucent, 2 to 3
minutes. Add the apple, apple cider, ginger, allspice, and
nutmeg. Cook (while scraping all the tasty bits off the bot-
tom with a wooden spoon), until the apples soften, about 5
minutes.
6. TRANSFER the applesauce to a food processor or blender
and blend until smooth.
7. PLACE the frisée on plates. Top with the pork and serve
with the applesauce.

### BACON FAT
If you’re lucky enough to have access to
Whole30-compliant bacon, save the fat the next time you
cook a batch. You can use it in heartier recipes like this one.
See page 404 for a list of Whole30 Approved bacon brands
(like the sugar-free pork bacon from U.S. Wellness Meats) and
sources.

## Notes

Don’t have access to frisée? You can use
arugula, baby kale, or baby spinach.
This dish can also make a delicious
reappearance at breakfast—fry an egg
or two and place over the top of the
leftover pork, using the applesauce and
freshly wilted greens as your side.
