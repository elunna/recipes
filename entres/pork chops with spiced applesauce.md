# pork chops with spiced applesauce
---
Yield: 2 servings

## Ingredients
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 2 bone-in pork chops (about 1 lb total)
- 3 tbsp cooking fat
- 1 onion, sliced
- 2 apples, peeled, cored and diced
- 1/2 cup apple cider
- 1/2 tsp ground ginger
- 1/2 tsp allspice
- 1 pinch nutmeg
- 2 generous handfuls frisée

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
2. Mix the salt and pepper in a small bowl and use to season both sides of the pork chops.
3. Melt 2 tbsp of the cooking fat in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
4. When the fat is hot, add the pork chops and sear until you see a golden brown crust, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn and sear the other side for 2 minutes.
5. Transfer the pork chops to a baking dish and roast in the oven until the internal temperature reaches 140°F, 10 to 15 minutes, depending on thickness.
6. While the pork is roasting, combine the remaining 1 tbsp fat and the onion in the same skillet. Cook over medium heat until the onion is translucent, 2 to 3 minutes.
7. Add the apple, apple cider, ginger, allspice, and nutmeg. Cook (while scraping all the tasty bits off the bottom with a wooden spoon), until the apples soften, about 5 minutes.
8. Transfer the applesauce to a food processor or blender and blend until smooth.
9. Place the frisée on plates. Top with the pork and serve with the applesauce.

### BACON FAT
If you’re lucky enough to have access to Whole30-compliant bacon, save the fat the next time you cook a batch. You can use it in heartier recipes like this one.

## Notes
Don’t have access to frisée? You can use arugula, baby kale, or baby spinach. This dish can also make a delicious reappearance at breakfast — fry an egg or two and place over the top of the leftover pork, using the applesauce and freshly wilted greens as your side.
