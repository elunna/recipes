# walnut-crusted pork tenderloin
---
Yield: 2 servings

## Ingredients
1 pound pork tenderloin
2 tablespoons mustard powder
1 tablespoon paprika
1 tablespoon onion powder
1 tablespoon garlic powder
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper
1/2 cup chopped walnuts
3 cups salad greens
1/2 cup Balsamic Vinaigrette (page 328)

## Instructions
1. REMOVE the pork from the refrigerator approximately
30 minutes before cooking.
2. PREHEAT the oven to 375°F.
3. IF necessary, trim the pork tenderloin, removing the tough
outer skin. (This is generally not necessary on boneless
cuts of pork loin, but see the tip below for details.) Pat the
tenderloin dry with a paper towel. Mix the mustard powder,
paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper ina
small bowl. Rub the pork evenly with the spice mixture.
4. IN a food processor or by hand, pulse or chop the walnuts
until finely chopped. Coat the pork evenly with three
quarters of the chopped walnuts. Place the tenderloin in
a baking pan and roast for 25 to 30 minutes, until the
internal temperature reaches 145°F. Let the pork rest for 10
minutes.
5. SLICE the tenderloin into %-inch-thick medallions. Place
the salad greens on plates, top with the pork slices, sprin-
kle the remaining chopped walnuts, and drizzle with the
Balsamic Vinaigrette.


### REMOVING PORK LOIN’S TOUGH OUTER MEMBRANE
Most boneless cuts of tenderloin won’t have much “silver
skin” (the tough membrane covering the top of a pork loin).
However, if yours does, you'll want to remove it before
cooking—otherwise it dries out in the oven and turns quite
tough. With a sharp paring or boning knife, pinch the meat to
pull the membrane away from the muscle. Remove the outer
skin by sliding the knife blade just beneath the membrane
and slowly cut along the muscle (with the grain of the meat)
in smooth sawing motions. You can also ask your butcher to
do this for you before he or she wraps up your purchase.

## Notes

Pork tenderloin is one of the leanest
and most tender cuts of pork, but it’s
also easy to overcook and dry out. It’s
best to rely on your meat thermometer
and not the clock for this cut—so
watch your temperatures carefully.
This recipe would work just as well
with pork chops; the cooking time in
the oven would be about the same.
