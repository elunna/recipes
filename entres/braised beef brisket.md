# braised beef brisket
---
Yield: 2 servings

## Ingredients
1 tbsp salt
1 tsp black pepper
1 1/2 lb beef brisket, trimmed
3 tbsp cooking fat
1/2 medium onion, peeled and quartered
4 cloves garlic, peeled
2 sprigs fresh thyme
5 cup Beef Bone Broth (page 178) or water

## Instructions
1. PREHEAT the oven to 350°F.
2. Mix the salt and pepper in a small bowl and use to season
the brisket evenly on both sides.
3. IN a Dutch oven or deep flameproof roasting pan, melt the cooking fat over medium-high heat, coating the bottom of the pan. When the fat is hot, add the brisket and sear until golden brown, ~2 minutes on each side. Remove the brisket from the pan.
4. REDUCE the heat to medium under the same pan and add the onion. Cook, scraping the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon to prevent burning, until the onion is softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until
aromatic, about 1 minute. Add the thyme, broth or water, and brisket, increase the heat to medium-high, and bring to a boil.
5. COVER the pot, transfer to the oven, and bake, turning the meat after each hour, for 3% to 4 hours, until the brisket is fork tender.
6. TRANSFER the brisket to a bowl and shred or slice thin, discarding the excess fat. Discard the thyme stems.
7. LADLE the cooking liquid, onions, and garlic from the pan into a food processor or blender. Blend the sauce completely. Place the pan back on the stovetop, return the sauce to the pan, and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Simmer until the sauce coats the back of a wooden spoon, ~5 minutes.
8. SERVE the brisket warm with the sauce.

MAKE IT A MEAL: Make this an easy dinner by adding 2 quartered peeled sweet potatoes, 1 diced peeled large butternut squash, and/or 4 to 6 roughly chopped carrots to the pan and cooking with the brisket.


## Notes

You could skip the first step, but we don’t recommend it: Browning the brisket creates a crust-like texture on the outside and a deep, rich flavor inside. Trust us, it’s worth the extra effort (and if you use
the same pan for stovetop and oven, it doesn’t create any more dishes to wash).


### FOR THE SLOW COOKER
This is the perfect dish to prep in the morning — you'll have dinner waiting for you as soon as you walk in the door from work.
Add all ingredients to the slow cooker, covering with broth or water just to the top of the meat (it should not require the full 5 cup). Cover and cook over low heat for 8 to 9 hours. If you have the time, follow the recipe instructions and brown the brisket on the stovetop first for extra flavor.
