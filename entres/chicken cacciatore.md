# chicken cacciatore
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients

4 tablespoons cooking fat
1 pound chicken legs (bone-in, skin-on)
1/2 pound chicken thighs (boneless)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 onion, minced
1/2 red bell pepper, finely diced
1 cup mushrooms, sliced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon capers, drained
1 14.5-ounce can diced tomatoes
1 cup chicken broth or water
1 tablespoon fresh basil leaves, rough chopped


## Instructions
1. IN a large skillet with high edges, heat 2 tablespoons of
the cooking fat over medium-high heat, swirling to coat
the bottom of the pan. Season the chicken with the salt and
pepper and place in the pan. Sear the chicken until golden
brown, about 3 minutes on each side. Remove the chicken
from the pan and set aside.
2. WITH the same pan still on medium-high heat, add the
remaining 2 tablespoons of cooking fat, onions, and peppers
and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes, until the onion becomes trans-
lucent. Add the mushrooms and continue to cook, stirring
for 2 minutes. Add the garlic and stir until aromatic, about 1
minute. Add the capers and diced tomatoes.
3. RETURN the chicken to the pan and cover everything with
the chicken broth or water. Reduce the heat to medium and
bring everything to a simmer. Turn the heat down to low
and continue to simmer (not boil) until the chicken reaches
an internal temperature of 160°F, about 30 minutes.
4. GARNISH with the chopped basil and serve.

### WITH A LITTLE PLANNING
you could buy a 2.5 to
3 pound whole chicken and use it to make this entire dish.
First, roast the chicken using the technique on page 157.
Strip the meat from the legs and thighs (keep the skin!) and
refrigerate for later. Then, take the chicken carcass and make
broth using the technique on page 177, When you're ready to
make this meal, start at the cacciatore instructions above,
adding the roasted meat to the sauce and simmering for just
10 minutes to heat it all the way through. This reduces the
cooking time to just 15 minutes, and makes the most of the
whole chicken.

### MAKE IT A MEAL: 
This one-pot meal technically stands alone, but to add
even more nutritional power, serve over Cauliflower Rice (page 272), a plate
of fresh baby spinach leaves, or a thin layer of mashed potatoes. For more of
an Italian feel, serve over zucchini noodles (see technique on page 272) or
Roasted Spaghetti Squash (page 294).

## Notes
While you could make this dish with
boneless, skinless everything, you'd
be missing out. The chicken skin holds
the fat, and fat equals flavor. Plus,
skin-on chicken retains the sauce
better, and gives a warm, rustic look
to the dish. While it’s not an official
rule, we’d recommend purchasing
pastured and/or organic chicken,
especially when you are making
dishes that include the chicken skin.
