# poached salmon with cucumber dill sauce
---
Yield: 2 servings

## Ingredients
- 1/2 cup rice vinegar
- Juice from 3 lemons, divided
- 1 bay leaf
- 6 black peppercorns
- 2 salmon fillets (5 oz each)
- 1/2 cup Basic Mayonnaise (page 179)
- 1/4 cup coconut cream (see page 178)
- 1/2 cucumber, peeled and diced
- 1/2 shallot, minced
- 2 sprigs fresh dill, leaves only, chopped
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1/2 lemon, thinly sliced

## Instructions
1. PREHEAT the oven to 400°F.
2. TO make the poaching liquid, combine 2 cup of water with
the rice vinegar, the juice of 2 lemons, the bay leaf, and pep-
percorns in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat,
then remove from the heat.
3. PLACE the salmon fillets skin-side down in a casserole
dish (choose a dish that is deeper than the thickness of the
salmon). Pour the poaching liquid over the salmon. Transfer ©
to the oven to poach until it’s slightly translucent when you
cut into the center, around 15 to 20 minutes, depending on
the thickness of the fillets.
4. WHILE the salmon is poaching, mix the juice of the remaining
lemon, the mayonnaise, coconut cream, cucumber, shallot, dill,
salt, and pepper in a small bowl.
5. DISCARD any poaching liquid left in the casserole, along
with the bay leaf and peppercorns. Place the salmon ona
serving dish or individual plates. Spoon the sauce over the
salmon and garnish with the lemon slices.

### PERFECT POACHED SALMON 
Overcooked salmon loses its
moisture and tenderness, so check often as you’re nearing the
end of your cooking time. It’s better to remove the salmon from
the oven slightly underdone, as it will continue to cook evenona
serving plate. Poke a butter knife into the salmon at the thickest
part and gently pull it apart. The flesh should be easily parted,
and look mostly opaque (not red and raw at the top). You should
see some white at the edges from the fat, and the flesh should
feel firm. Don’t cook it until the flesh easily fakes, though—that’s
a sign of overcooking. Poaching is a very forgiving technique,
even if you leave it in the poaching liquid a little too long, your
fish will still be moist and tender.

## Notes

Poaching fish helps keep it moist while
adding and infusing flavor, but if
you’re short on time (or ingredients),
you can use our Perfect Oven-Baked
Salmon technique on page 160. Make
a double batch of this Cucumber
Dill Sauce, as it’s delicious mixed
into a Protein Salad (page 161).
