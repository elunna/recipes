# banger sausage patties with sweet potato mash and caramelized onions
---
Yield: 2 servings

## Ingredients
- 1 lb ground pork
- 1/4 tsp ground sage
- 1/4 tsp garlic powder
- 1/4 tsp dried thyme
- 1/4 tsp onion powder
- 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper
- 1/8 tsp nutmeg
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/8 tsp black pepper
- Grated zest of 1 lemon

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 350F.
2. Bring 4 cups of water to a boil in a medium pot over medium-high heat. Line
   a baking sheet with parchment paper.
3. PREPARE THE SAUSAGE: In a large mixing bowl, mix all the sausage
   ingredients. Form into 8 equal patties. Place on a plate and chill in the
   freezer for 10-15 minutes while starting the sweet potato mash.
4. Cook the sweet potatoes in the boiling water until fork tender, 10-15
   minutes. Drain and return the potatoes to the pot. Add 1 tablespoon of the
   ghee and coconut milk. Using a potato masher, immersion blender, or large
   kitchen fork, mash and mix the sweet potatoes with the ghee andthe coconut
   milk. Cover the pot to keep warm and set aside.
5. Remove the sausage from the freezer and place on the parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Bake the sausafe patties in the oven for 12-15 minutes, until the internal temp reaches 145F, and no pink remains in the middle of the patty.
6. Meanwhile, heat the remaining 3 tbsp of ghee in a large skillet over medium
   heat, swirling to coat the bottom of the pan. When the ghee is hot, add the
   onion and cook for 15 minutes, turning them periodically as they begin to
   brown and caramelize. (Do not rush this step - the browner the color, the
   more concentrated the flavor will be).
7. Transfer the mashed sweet potatoes to a bowl or serving dish and top with
   the caramelized onions. Season with salt and pepper and stir to combine.
   Serve with the sausage patties.

### MAKE IT A MEAL:
Double the sweet potato mash recipe and you've got an easy side dish for
tomorrow night's dinner - serve with Braised Beef Brisket, Walnut-Crusted Port
Tenderloin, or Halibut with Citrus-Ginger Glaze.

### CARAMELIZING ONIONS
Caramelizing the onion adds so much flavor to this dish, but it takes care and
patience. First, don't slice the onions too thin or they'll dry out too much
while cooking. Aim for slices about 1/8 inch thick. Make sure you use a large
enough pan - crowd your onions and they'll steam instead of caramelize.
Finally, don't rush the process! Onions should be soft in texture and a rich
brown color before you pull them off the stove.

## Notes
Prepare the spice mixture for future meals - quadruple it. Store the rest in
an airtight container.
