# Build-Your-Own Buddha Bowl
---
Yield:

## Ingredients
### Rice and veggies

1 ¼ cups short-grain brown rice or long-grain brown rice, rinsed
1 ½ cups frozen shelled edamame, preferably organic
1 ½ cups trimmed and roughly chopped snap peas or snow peas, or thinly sliced broccoli florets
1 to 2 tablespoons reduced-sodium tamari or soy sauce, to taste
4 cups chopped red cabbage or spinach or romaine lettuce or kale (ribs removed)
2 ripe avocados, halved, pitted and thinly sliced into long strips (wait to slice just before serving, see details in step 5)

### Essential garnishes
1 small cucumber, very thinly sliced
Carrot ginger dressing*
Thinly sliced green onion (about ½ small bunch)
Lime wedges
Toasted sesame oil, for drizzling
Sesame seeds
Flaky sea salt

## Instructions
1. Bring a large pot of water to boil (ideally about 4 quarts water). Once the water is boiling, add the rice and continue boiling for 25 minutes. Add the edamame and cook for 3 more minutes (it’s ok if the water doesn’t reach a rapid boil again). Then add the snap peas and cook for 2 more minutes.
2. Drain well, and return the rice and veggies to the pot. Season to taste with 1 to 2 tablespoons of tamari or soy sauce, and stir to combine.
3. Divide the rice/veggie mixture and raw veggies into 4 bowls. Arrange cucumber slices along the edge of the bowl (see photos). Drizzle lightly with carrot ginger dressing and top with sliced green onion. Place a lime wedge or 2 in each bowl.
4. When you’re ready to serve, divide the avocado into the bowls. Lightly drizzle sesame oil over the avocado, followed by a generous sprinkle of sesame seeds and flaky sea salt. Serve promptly.
5. If you intend to have leftovers, wait to complete step 4 just before serving (otherwise the avocado will brown too soon). Leftover bowls keep well (avocado excluded) for 4 to 5 days in the refrigerator.


## Notes

*Carrot ginger dressing note: You’re probably only going to need ½ batch of the dressing for 4 bowls. I recommend making the full batch since blenders require a decent volume of liquid to blend. Just use the leftover dressing on salads within 1 to 2 weeks of making.

*Make it quick: If you’re in a hurry, you can skip the dressing and drizzle tamari and toasted sesame oil lightly over the bowls instead.

Make it vegan: Be sure to follow the vegan option while making the carrot-ginger dressing.

Make it gluten free: Be sure to use certified gluten-free tamari, instead of soy sauce. Or, omit the soy sauce altogether and season the rice with salt, to taste.

Make it soy free: Omit the tamari/soy sauce and season the rice with salt, to taste.

Recommended equipment: I love my Vitamix blender for making the dressing and this colander for draining the rice and veggies (those are affiliate links).
