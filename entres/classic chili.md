# classic chili
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
- 1 lb ground meat (beef, lamb, bison)
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1 tsp chili powder
- 1/2 tsp paprika
- 1/2 tsp mustard powder
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 red bell pepper, finely chopped
- 1 green bell pepper, finely chopped
- 1 can (14.5 oz) diced tomatoes
- 2 cup beef broth

## Instructions
1. Heat a large pot or high-walled skillet over medium-high heat (without cooking fat). 
2. Add the ground meat and cook until the meat is fully browned, 7 to 10 minutes. 
3. Remove the meat from the pot with a slotted spoon and transfer it to a side dish, keeping the leftover fat in the pot.
4. Add the onions, garlic, cumin, chili powder, paprika, mustard powder, and salt to the pot.
5. Reduce the heat to medium low and cook until the onions are translucent, 4-5 minutes.
6. Add the bell peppers, tomatoes, and broth and return the meat to the pot. 
7. Turn the heat up to high. When the chili reaches a boil, reduce the heat to low and simmer uncovered for 1 hour.

### Make in a slow cooker
This recipe can easily be made in a slow cooker.  Follow all of the directions exactly as above, up to the point when your onions are translucent. At that point, transfer the contents from the pot to your slow cooker. Add the bell peppers, tomatoes, and broth and set to low heat, cooking for 6 to 8 hours.

## Notes
Different garnish options can really - change the flavor of this dish. Try topping with fresh cilantro, jalapenos, crushed red pepper, or a drizzle of Ranch Dressing. If you’re active and need to eat more carbohydrates, cut some potatoes or butternut squash into small cubes and add them to the pot just before simmering, or serve your chili in a “bowl” of roasted acorn squash halves.
