---
Yield: 

## Ingredients

1 lb ground meat (beef, lamb, bison)
1 onion, finely chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tsp cumin
1 tsp chili powder
1/2 tsp paprika
1/2 tsp mustard powder
1/2 tsp salt
1 red bell pepper, finely chopped
1 green bell pepper, finely chopped
1 can (14.5 oz) diced tomatoes
2 cup beef broth

## Instructions
1. HEAT a large pot or high-walled skillet over medium-high
heat (without cooking fat). 
2. Add the ground meat and cook
until the meat is fully browned, 7 to 10 minutes. 
3. Remove
the meat from the pot with a slotted spoon and transfer it to
a side dish, keeping the leftover fat in the pot.
4. ADD the onions, garlic, cumin, chili powder, paprika, mus-
tard powder, and salt to the pot.
5.  Reduce the heat to medium
low and cook until the onions are translucent,
4 to 5 minutes.
6. ADD the bell peppers, tomatoes, and broth and return the
meat to the pot. 
7. Turn the heat up to high. When the chili
reaches a boil, reduce the heat to low and simmer uncov-
ered for 1 hour.

### THIS RECIPE 
can easily be made in a slow cooker.
Follow all of the directions exactly as above, up to the point
when your onions are translucent. At that point, transfer
the contents from the pot to your slow cooker. Add the bell
peppers, tomatoes, and broth and set to low heat, cooking for
6 to 8 hours.

## Notes

Different garnish options can really
- change the flavor of this dish. Try topping
with fresh cilantro, jalapefios, crushed
_ red pepper, or a drizzle of Ranch
Dressing (page 316). If you’re active
and need to eat more carbohydrates, cut
some potatoes or butternut squash into
small cubes and add them to the pot just
before simmering, or serve your chili in a
“bowl” of roasted acorn squash halves.
