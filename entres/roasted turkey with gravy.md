2 bay leaves, torn in half
1 orange, quartered
2 lemons, quartered
3 sprigs fresh thyme
3 sprigs fresh rosemary
3 quarts ice

### LEMON BROTH AND TURKEY FIXINGS

### GRAVY
2 tablespoons cooking fat
Neck and giblets from the turkey
1 large onion, diced
1 celery rib, diced
1 carrot, diced
2 cups chicken broth (page 177)
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
2 tablespoons pan drippings (or clarified butter/ghee)
3 tablespoons arrowroot powder

## Instructions
1. IF you’ve bought a frozen turkey, make sure
it’s completely thawed before brining. (Allow
approximately one day of thawing in the refrig-
erator for every 5 pounds of turkey.) 
2. Remove the
neck and giblets (usually contained in a bag)
from the turkey’s cavity and save them in the
refrigerator—you'll use them for the gravy.
3. TO MAKE THE BRINE: Pour the hot water
into a very large pot. Add the salt and whisk to
dissolve. Continue to whisk while adding the
apple juice, peppercorns, and bay leaves. Juice
the orange and lemons into the brine. Add the
thyme and rosemary and mix well. Whisk in the
ice, adding 1 quart at a time.
4. PLACE the thawed turkey in a large pot or a
plastic brining bag and cover with the brine.
Refrigerate the brining turkey for 12 to 24 hours.
5. TO MAKE THE LEMON BROTH:
Mix the
chicken broth and lemon juice in a large bowl
and set aside.
6. PREHEAT the oven to 325°F.
7. REMOVE the turkey from the brine and pat it
dry with paper towels.
8.  Season inside and out
with the salt and pepper. 
9. Stuff the cavity with
the apple, carrots, onion, half of the thyme, and
half of the rosemary. 
10. Using your fingers, care-
fully work 1/4 cup of the cooking fat and the
remainder of the thyme and rosemary leaves
evenly under the turkey skin. Brush or rub the
skin with the remaining 1/2 cup cooking fat.

11. SET the turkey breast-side up in a roasting pan.
Cover it loosely with foil, securing around the
edges of the pan to create a tent. Roast for 2 hours.
12. REMOVE the turkey from the oven and discard
the foil. 
13. Baste the entire turkey with 1 cup of the
lemon broth,
14. then increase the oven temperature
to 375°F and place the turkey back in the oven.
Roast for 20 minutes.
15. Baste with another cup of
lemon broth, then roast for an additional 20 minutes,

16. Baste again with the last cup of broth. Roast
for an additional 20 minute, until the turkey’s
internal temperature on the leg reaches 160°F.
(A meat thermometer is important here.)


17. LET the turkey rest for 20 to 40 minutes, or
until the internal temperature reaches 165°F.
Transfer the turkey to a carving board. Scoop
the stuffing from the middle of the turkey and
discard, then begin carving.

### TO MAKE THE GRAVY:
Heat the cooking fat in
a large pot over medium-high heat. When the fat
is hot, sear the turkey neck and giblets for 5 min-
utes, turning to prevent burning. Add the onion,
celery, and carrot. Cook, stirring occasionally for
5 minutes, until the onions are translucent. Add
the chicken broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the
heat to medium and simmer the ingredients for
10 minutes, until the carrots are very soft.

REMOVE the turkey neck and giblets and dis-
card. Transfer the broth and vegetables to a food
processor, add the salt and pepper, and blend to
a smooth consistency. Reserve the gravy until
the turkey is out of the oven.

CAREFULLY pour the turkey pan drippings
into a pot with the gravy mixture (or add
2 tablespoons of clarified butter or ghee, if the
drippings prove hard to transfer). Return the
gravy to a pot on medium heat and bring to a
simmer.

IN a small bowl, mix the arrowroot powder and
1/3 cup of cold water and mix well. It should feel
like a paste at first, then blend into a milky-white
consistency. (Do not mix the powder directly
into the gravy, or it will clump instead of mix!)

TAKE the gravy off the heat and immediately
add the arrowroot and water mixture. The heat
from the gravy will activate the thickening
power of the starch; stir well until the gravy
thickens.
