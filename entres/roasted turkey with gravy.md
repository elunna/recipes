Yield: 

## Ingredients
### BRINE AND TURKEY
- 8- to 10-lb turkey
- 5 qt hot tap water
- 1 cup salt
- 2 cup apple juice
- 1 tbsp black peppercorns
- 2 bay leaves, torn in half
- 1 orange, quartered
- 2 lemons, quartered
- 3 sprigs fresh thyme
- 3 sprigs fresh rosemary
- 3 qt ice

### LEMON BROTH AND TURKEY FIXINGS
- 3 cup chicken broth
- Juice of 2 lemons
- 2 tsp salt
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 1 apple, peeled and cored
- 2 carrots, peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1 white onion, peeled and quartered
- Leaves of 4 sprigs fresh thyme
- Leaves of 2 sprigs fresh rosemary
- 3/4 cup clarified butter, ghee, duck fat, or coconut oil

### GRAVY
- 2 tbsp cooking fat
- Neck and giblets from the turkey
- 1 large onion, diced
- 1 celery rib, diced
- 1 carrot, diced
- 2 cup chicken broth
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- 2 tbsp pan drippings (or clarified butter/ghee)
- 3 tbsp arrowroot powder

## Instructions
1. If you’ve bought a frozen turkey, make sure it’s completely thawed before brining. (Allow approximately one day of thawing in the refrigerator for every 5 lb of turkey.) 
2. Remove the neck and giblets (usually contained in a bag) from the turkey’s cavity and save them in the refrigerator — you'll use them for the gravy.
3. TO MAKE THE BRINE: Pour the hot water into a very large pot. Add the salt and whisk to dissolve. Continue to whisk while adding the apple juice, peppercorns, and bay leaves. Juice the orange and lemons into the brine. Add the thyme and rosemary and mix well. Whisk in the ice, adding 1 qt at a time.
4. Place the thawed turkey in a large pot or a plastic brining bag and cover with the brine.  Refrigerate the brining turkey for 12 to 24 hours.
5. TO MAKE THE LEMON BROTH: Mix the chicken broth and lemon juice in a large bowl and set aside.
6. Preheat the oven to 325°F.
7. Remove the turkey from the brine and pat it dry with paper towels.
8. Season inside and out with the salt and pepper. 
9. Stuff the cavity with the apple, carrots, onion, half of the thyme, and half of the rosemary. 
10. Using your fingers, carefully work 1/4 cup of the cooking fat and the remainder of the thyme and rosemary leaves evenly under the turkey skin. Brush or rub the skin with the remaining 1/2 cup cooking fat.
11. Set the turkey breast-side up in a roasting pan. Cover it loosely with foil, securing around the edges of the pan to create a tent. Roast for 2 hours.
12. Remove the turkey from the oven and discard the foil. 
13. Baste the entire turkey with 1 cup of the lemon broth.
14. Increase the oven temperature to 375°F and place the turkey back in the oven.  Roast for 20 minutes.
15. Baste with another cup of lemon broth, then roast for an additional 20 minutes,
16. Baste again with the last cup of broth. Roast for an additional 20 minute, until the turkey’s internal temperature on the leg reaches 160°F.  (A meat thermometer is important here.)
17. Let the turkey rest for 20 to 40 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F. Transfer the turkey to a carving board. Scoop the stuffing from the middle of the turkey and discard, then begin carving.

### TO MAKE THE GRAVY:
1. Heat the cooking fat in a large pot over medium-high heat.
2. When the fat is hot, sear the turkey neck and giblets for 5 minutes, turning to prevent burning.
3. Add the onion, celery, and carrot. Cook, stirring occasionally for 5 minutes, until the onions are translucent.
4. Add the chicken broth and bring to a boil.
5. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer the ingredients for 10 minutes, until the carrots are very soft.
6. Remove the turkey neck and giblets and discard.
7. Transfer the broth and vegetables to a food processor, add the salt and pepper, and blend to a smooth consistency.
8. Reserve the gravy until the turkey is out of the oven.
9. Carefully pour the turkey pan drippings into a pot with the gravy mixture (or add 2 tbsp of clarified butter or ghee, if the drippings prove hard to transfer).
10. Return the gravy to a pot on medium heat and bring to a simmer.
11. In a small bowl, mix the arrowroot powder and 1/3 cup of cold water and mix well. It should feel like a paste at first, then blend into a milky-white consistency. (Do not mix the powder directly into the gravy, or it will clump instead of mix!)
12. Take the gravy off the heat and immediately add the arrowroot and water mixture. The heat from the gravy will activate the thickening power of the starch; stir well until the gravy thickens.
