# Build-Your-Own Buddha Bowl
---
Yield:

## Ingredients
### Rice and veggies
- 1 1/4 cup short(or long)-grain brown rice, rinsed
- 1 1/2 cup frozen shelled edamame, preferably organic
- 1 1/2 cup trimmed and roughly chopped snap peas or snow peas, or thinly sliced broccoli florets
- 1-2 tbsp reduced-sodium tamari or soy sauce, to taste
- 4 cup chopped red cabbage/spinach/romaine/kale (ribs removed)
- 2 ripe avocados, halved, pitted and thinly sliced into long strips (wait to slice just before serving, see details in step 5)

### Essential garnishes
- 1 small cucumber, very thinly sliced
- Carrot ginger dressing
- Thinly sliced green onion (about 1/2 small bunch)
- Lime wedges
- Toasted sesame oil, for drizzling
- Sesame seeds
- Flaky sea salt

## Instructions
1. Bring a large pot of water to boil (ideally about 4 qt water).
2. Once the water is boiling, add the rice and continue boiling for 25 minutes.
3. Add the edamame and cook for 3 more minutes (it’s ok if the water doesn’t reach a rapid boil again).
4. Then add the snap peas and cook for 2 more minutes.
5. Drain well, and return the rice and veggies to the pot.
6. Season to taste with 1 to 2 tbsp of tamari or soy sauce, and stir to combine.
7. Divide the rice/veggie mixture and raw veggies into 4 bowls. Arrange cucumber slices along the edge of the bowl.
8. Drizzle lightly with carrot ginger dressing and top with sliced green onion. Place a lime wedge or 2 in each bowl.
9. When you’re ready to serve, divide the avocado into the bowls. Lightly drizzle sesame oil over the avocado, followed by a generous sprinkle of sesame seeds and flaky sea salt. Serve promptly.

If you intend to have leftovers, wait to complete step 4 just before serving (otherwise the avocado will brown too soon). Leftover bowls keep well (avocado excluded) for 4 to 5 days in the refrigerator.


## Notes

Carrot ginger dressing note: You’re probably only going to need 1/2 batch of the dressing for 4 bowls. I recommend making the full batch since blenders require a decent volume of liquid to blend. Just use the leftover dressing on salads within 1 to 2 weeks of making.

Make it quick: If you’re in a hurry, you can skip the dressing and drizzle tamari and toasted sesame oil lightly over the bowls instead.

Make it vegan: Be sure to follow the vegan option while making the carrot-ginger dressing.

Make it gluten free: Be sure to use certified gluten-free tamari, instead of soy sauce. Or, omit the soy sauce altogether and season the rice with salt, to taste.

Make it soy free: Omit the tamari/soy sauce and season the rice with salt, to taste.

Recommended equipment: I love my Vitamix blender for making the dressing and this colander for draining the rice and veggies (those are affiliate links).
