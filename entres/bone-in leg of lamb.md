# bone-in leg of lamb
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
- 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- Grated zest and juice of 1 lemon
- 1 tbsp fresh rosemary
- 1 tbsp fresh thyme
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1 bone-in leg of lamb (6 to 8 lb)

## Instructions
1. Combine the olive oil, lemon zest and juice, rosemary, thyme, salt, and pepper in a large non-reactive mixing bowl and whisk until blended.
2. Pat the lamb dry with a paper towel, place in the bowl with the marinade, and turn to coat all of the meat. 
3. Cover with aluminum foil and refrigerate for 8 hours, turning the lamb and basting after 4 hours. (If you don’t have a turkey baster, just use a large spoon to pour the marinade over the lamb a few times.)
4. Preheat the oven to 400°F. 
5. Place the marinated lamb in a large roasting pan and roast uncovered for 30 minutes. 
6. Reduce the oven temperature to 325°F and continue roasting for 90 minutes to 2 hours, until the internal temperature is 135°F (for medium rare) or 140°F (for medium). Cooking times will vary depending on the size of your lamb and your oven, so begin checking the temperature with a meat thermometer at the 90-minute mark, and continue to check every 10 minutes thereafter.
7. Remove the lamb from the oven and allow it to rest for 10 minutes before carving as described in the menu introduction.
