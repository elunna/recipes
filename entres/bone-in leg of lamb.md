# bone-in leg of lamb
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
- 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- Grated zest and juice of 1 lemon
- 1 tbsp fresh rosemary
- 1 tbsp fresh thyme
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1 bone-in leg of lamb (6 to 8 lb)


## Instructions
1. COMBINE the olive oil, lemon zest and juice,
rosemary, thyme, salt, and pepper in a large non-
reactive mixing bowl and whisk until blended.

2. Pat the lamb dry with a paper towel, place in the
bowl with the marinade, and turn to coat all of
the meat. 
3. Cover with aluminum foil and refriger-
ate for 8 hours, turning the lamb and basting
after 4 hours. (If you don’t have a turkey baster,
just use a large spoon to pour the marinade over
the lamb a few times.)
4. PREHEAT the oven to 400°F. 
5. Place the mari-
nated lamb in a large roasting pan and roast
uncovered for 30 minutes. 
6. Reduce the oven
temperature to 325°F and continue roasting for
90 minutes to 2 hours, until the internal tem-
perature is 135°F (for medium rare) or 140°F (for
medium). Cooking times will vary depending
on the size of your lamb and your oven, so begin
checking the temperature with a meat thermom-
eter at the 90-minute mark, and continue to
check every 10 minutes thereafter.
7. REMOVE the lamb from the oven and allow it to
rest for 10 minutes before carving as described
in the menu introduction.
