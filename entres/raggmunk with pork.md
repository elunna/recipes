---
Yield: 4 servings
Prep time: 45 min

## Ingredients
- 2 dl wheat flour
- 4 dl milk
- 2 egg
- 2 tbsp salt
- pepper
- 900g solid potato, finely shredded
- about 375g sliced salted pork or steak pork (or 950g)
- 2 tbsp cooking fat
- 3 carrots. finely shredded

For serving
- lingonberries and/or strawberries, mixed with a little honey

## Instructions

Make sure the pork is mostly frozen beforehand so it's easier to slice

1. Set oven to 125Â° C and insert a plate for stowing the pancakes.

2. Slice and fry the pork crispy in a frying pan. Put it on the plate in the oven and keep it warm. Keep the oil for frying the pancakes.

3. Whisk the flour with half the milk to a smooth batter in a bowl. Whisk down the rest of the milk, eggs and salt.

4. Peel and shred the potatoes finely. Squeeze the liquid out and turn it into the batter immediately so that it does not darken.

5. Heat some cooking fat in a frying pan and scoop up ~1/4 cup batter and fry the pancakes in turns. Keep them warm on the plate in the oven.

6. Peel the carrots and cut into rods or shred.

For serving: Serve the pork with ragg donuts, carrots and lingonberry jam.

## Notes

Tonight's dinner is a wonderfully good house dish where flavors and textures meet. Raggmunkarna fry until golden brown and just crispy and served with crispy pork and sweet and sour lingonberry jam that lifts the dish further. Have a nice meal!

Tip: Fry the ragg donuts in the fat from the pork for more flavor.

It is important to squeeze the liquid out of the potato otherwise they will turn gray in color.
