# no-fuss salmon cakes
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
- 3 6-oz cans wild-caught salmon (boneless, or bones removed)
- 1 cup canned sweet potatoes
- 1 egg
- 1/2 cup almond flour
- 2 scallions, thinly sliced, plus extra for garnish
- 2 tbsp fresh parsley, minced (or 2 tsp dried)
- 2 tbsp fresh minced dill (or 2 tsp dried)
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp paprika
- 1/4 tsp ground black pepper
- 2 tbsp clarified butter, ghee, or coconut oil, melted
- Lemon wedges for serving (optional)

## Instructions
1. PREHEAT the oven to 425°F and cover a large baking
sheet with parchment paper.
2. DRAIN the liquid from the salmon and crumble the fish
into a large mixing bowl, removing the bones and flaking
the fish with a fork. 
3. Add the sweet potato, egg, almond flour,
scallions, parsley, dill, salt, paprika, and pepper and mix
well with a wooden spoon.
4. BRUSH the parchment paper with the melted fat, then use
a 1/3-cup measuring cup to scoop the cakes and drop them
onto the parchment. Flatten the patties with your hand
until they are uniform in thickness.
5. BAKE for 20 minutes, then flip each patty with a spatula
and return to the oven. Bake until golden brown, about
10 more minutes.
6. SERVE with sliced scallions and lemon wedges for squeez-
ing over the top, if desired.

## Notes
created by Melissa Joulwan for It Starts With Food

YOU CAN FIND de-boned canned salmon at your local
health food store—that will save you about 10 minutes of prep
time. Look for wild-caught to ensure you’re getting the highest
level of nutrition, especially anti-inhammatory omega-3 fatty
acids like EPA and DHA. These fatty acids come from the
food wild salmon eat, like algae and krill. Farmed salmon
don’t eat these foods, so they don’t contain the same healthy
fats.


While these salmon cakes are a complete
meal on their own (especially topped
with the Tartar Sauce on page 312),
they pair well with sautéed green beans
and a fresh garden salad, our Grilled
Asparagus with Lemon Zest (page 284),
or Roasted Sweet Potatoes (page 296).
They also reheat beautifully, so make a
double-batch and enjoy these for break-
fast the next day—top two cakes with
some wilted spinach and a fried egg.
