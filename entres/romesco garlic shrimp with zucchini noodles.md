# romesco garlic shrimp with zucchini noodles
---
Yield: 2 servings

## Ingredients
4 medium zucchini (about 4 cup
of “noodles”)
2 tbsp cooking fat
1/4 onion, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 lb large shrimp, peeled
and deveined
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp black pepper
2 tsp chopped fresh
parsley leaves
Romesco Sauce (page 318)

## Instructions
1. PEEL the zucchini with a regular peeler. Then, using a juli-
enne peeler, make long slices along one side of each zucchini
until you get down to the seeded core. Rotate the zucchini
and continue to peel until you’ve done all four sides. (If you
have a spiral slicer, you can use that instead of a julienne
peeler.) Discard the core, and set the noodles aside.
2. ADD 2 cup of water to a large pot over medium-high heat
and bring to a boil while you begin cooking the shrimp.
3. MELT the cooking fat in a large skillet over medium heat,
swirling to coat the bottom of the pan. When the fat is hot,
add the onion and cook, stirring, until translucent, about 2
minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook until aromatic, about 1
minute. Add the shrimp, toss to coat with the onion and garlic,
and cook stirring, for 2 minutes. Add 1/4 cup water to the skillet
and cover with a lid. Cook until the shrimp form the shape of
a “C,” 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer to a serving bowl (draining any
remaining water), and season with the salt and pepper.
4. AFTER you add the water and cover the shrimp, place a col-
ander or steamer inside the large pot of boiling water. Add
the zucchini noodles, cover, and steam until the zucchini is
al dente in texture, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain the “zoodles” and
transfer to a serving dish or individual plates.
5. SPRINKLE the shrimp with the parsley, toss, and spoon
over the zoodles. Spoon the Romesco Sauce over the shrimp
and zucchini and serve.

### SHRIMP 
Shrimp are quite easy to prepare, but they get
tougher the longer you cook them. Perfectly cooked shrimp will
be pink in color, and shaped like a “C’—if they are curled up
tightly into an “O” shape, they’re overcooked. If you’re using
frozen shrimp, make sure they are completely thawed before
you start cooking.

## Notes

You can save yourself 25 minutes of
prep time and make your Romesco
Sauce up to two days in advance. This
dish is just as delicious served cold,
substituting Pesto (page 315) for the
Romesco Sauce, and cold cucumber
noodles instead of steamed zoodles. You
can also cheat and buy cooked shrimp—
just skip the 1/4 cup water and covered
cooking at the end of the third step.
