# no-fuss salmon cakes
---
Yield: 2 servings
Prep time: 45 min

## Ingredients
3 6-oz cans wild-caught salmon (boneless or bones removed)
1 cup canned sweet potatoes
1 egg 
1/2 cup almond flour
3 scallions, thinly sliced, plus extra for garnish
2 tbsp fresh parsley, minced (or 2 tsp dried)
2 tbsp fresh minced dill (or 2 tsp dried)
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp paprika
1/4 tsp ground black pepper
2 tbsp ghee/coconut oil
lemon wedges for serving


## Instructions
- Preheat oven to 425F and cover a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
- Drain the liquid from the salmon and crumble the fish into a large mixing bowl, removing the bones and flaking the fish with a fork. Add the sweet potato, egg, almond flour, scallions, parsley, dill, salt, paprika, and pepper and mix well with a wooden spoon.
- Brush the parchment paper with the melted fat, then use a 1/3 cup measuring cup to scoop the cakes and drop them onto the parchment. Flatten the patties with your hand until they are uniform in thickness.
- Bake for 20 min, then flip each patty with a spatula and return to the oven. Bake until golden brown, ~10 more minutes.
- Serve with sliced scallions and lemon wedges.

## Notes

Whole30

Pair with Tartar sauce!

Also try pairing with sauteed green beans and a fresh garden salad, grilled asparagus, or roasted sweet potatoes.

- They also reheat beautifully, so make a double-batch and enjoy these for breakfast the next day - top two cakes with some wilted spinach and a fried egg.
