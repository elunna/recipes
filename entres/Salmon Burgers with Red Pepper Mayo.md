# Salmon Burgers with Red Pepper Mayo
---
Yield: Makes 4 burgers

## Ingredients
### For the red pepper mayo:
1 cup mayonnaise
1/4 cup (packed) coarsely chopped and drained roasted red bell peppers
2 teaspoons drained capers
2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt

### For the burgers:
1/2 cup plain breadcrumbs
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
18 ounces canned salmon, drained, picked through, flaked
2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided
4 hamburger buns
1/3 cup drained roasted red bell peppers, cut into 1/4" strips

## Instructions
1. Mayo: Blend mayonnaise, bell peppers, capers, lemon juice, and salt in a blender, scraping down sides if needed, until smooth. Transfer to a small bowl.
2. Burgers: Mix breadcrumbs, pepper, and 1/2 cup red pepper mayo in a large bowl. Gently fold in flaked salmon. Divide mixture into 4 patties about 1/2" thick and 4" wide.
3. Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in a large nonstick or cast-iron skillet over medium-high until shimmering. Working in batches, cook buns, cut side down, until golden brown and toasted, about 2 minutes. Divide among plates.
4. Heat remaining 1 Tbsp. oil in same skillet. Cook salmon patties until golden brown and heated through, 2â€“3 minutes per side. Transfer burgers to bun bottoms. Spread about 2 tsp. red pepper mayo over burgers. Arrange bell pepper strips over, then top with bun to close.

Red pepper mayo can be made 5 days ahead. Store in a resealable container and chill. Burger patties can be formed 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.
