# harvest grilled chicken salad
---
Yield: 2 servings

## Ingredients
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1 pound boneless, skinless chicken
breasts
4 cups lettuce leaves (torn into
l-inch pieces)
1/2 Granny Smith apple, cored and
sliced or diced
1/2 cucumber, sliced or diced
1/4 cup dried cranberries (sweetened
with apple juice)
Raspberry Walnut Vinaigrette
(page 328)

## Instructions
1. REHEAT a grill to medium-high heat (875° to 450°F).
2. IN a small bowl, mix together the salt, pepper, cumin,
chili powder, garlic powder, and onion powder. Season the
chicken evenly with the mixture. Grill the chicken, turning
once, until the internal temperature reaches 160°F or until
the flesh springs back when pressed, 3 to 4 minutes per
side. Let the chicken rest for 5 minutes before slicing into
thin strips.
3. IN a large salad bowl, combine the lettuce, apple, cucum-
ber, and cranberries. Top with the sliced chicken. Toss all
of the ingredients lightly with the vinaigrette just before
serving.

## Notes
If you can’t find cranberries sweetened
with apple juice, substitute raisins or
currants. For the perfect office lunch,
just layer the salad in a large mason
jar and throw on the lid. Layer the
ingredients in this order for maximum
awesomeness and minimum sogginess:
dressing, chicken (make sure it’s cool),
vegetables and fruit, and as much lettuce
as you can fit on top. When you’re
ready to eat, just shake and serve!

(and use the carcass to make the Bone Broth from page 177),
add a scoop of the Protein Salad (page 161) sitting in your
fridge, or substitute canned chicken, tuna, salmon, or hard-
boiled eggs.
