# harvest grilled chicken salad
---
Yield: 2 servings

## Ingredients
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1/2 tsp ground cumin
- 1/2 tsp chili powder
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp onion powder
- 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 4 cup lettuce leaves (torn into 1-inch pieces)
- 1/2 Granny Smith apple, cored and sliced or diced
- 1/2 cucumber, sliced or diced
- 1/4 cup dried cranberries (sweetened with apple juice)
- Raspberry Walnut Vinaigrette

## Instructions
1. Reheat a grill to medium-high heat (875° to 450°F).
2. In a small bowl, mix together the salt, pepper, cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, and onion powder.
3. Season the chicken evenly with the mixture.
4. Grill the chicken, turning once, until the internal temperature reaches 160°F or until the flesh springs back when pressed, 3 to 4 minutes per side.
5. Let the chicken rest for 5 minutes before slicing into thin strips.
6. In a large salad bowl, combine the lettuce, apple, cucumber, and cranberries. Top with the sliced chicken.
7. Toss all of the ingredients lightly with the vinaigrette just before
serving.

## Notes
If you can’t find cranberries sweetened with apple juice, substitute raisins or currants. For the perfect office lunch, just layer the salad in a large mason jar and throw on the lid. Layer the ingredients in this order for maximum awesomeness and minimum sogginess:
1. dressing,
2. chicken (make sure it’s cool),
3. vegetables and fruit,
4. and as much lettuce as you can fit on top. 

### CHICKEN SUBSTITUTIONS 
- You don't need to grill the chicken, it can be seared and roasted.
- No time to cook? Purchase a compliant rotisserie chicken (and use the carcass to make the Bone Broth),
- add a scoop of the Protein Salad sitting in your fridge,
- or substitute canned chicken, tuna, salmon, or hard-boiled eggs.
