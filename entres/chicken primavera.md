---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
2 tbsp cooking fat
1/2 cup diced onions
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tsp minced fresh oregano
1 tsp fresh thyme
3 cup diced seeded tomatoes (about
3 large tomatoes)
1 lb boneless, skinless chicken
thighs, 1-inch diced
2 cup green beans, cut into 1-inch pieces

1 1/2 cup medium-diced zucchini
1 1/2 cup medium-diced yellow squash

1/4 tsp red pepper flakes
1 tsp salt
1/2 tsp black pepper
1 to 2 tbsp minced fresh basil leaves

## Instructions
1. IN a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the cooking fat on
medium-high heat and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan.

2. Add the onions, garlic, oregano, and thyme and cook until
the onions are translucent and the garlic is fragrant, 2 to
3 minutes.
3. ADD the tomatoes and chicken to the pot and cook, stir-
ring occasionally, until the tomatoes have softened, 3 to
4 minutes. 
4. Add the green beans, zucchini, and squash and
cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are crisp-
tender and the chicken is cooked through (with no pink
remaining in the center), 5 to 6 minutes. 
5. Add the red pep-
per flakes, salt, and pepper, sprinkle on the basil, stir for
30 seconds to incorporate, and serve immediately.


### TAKE SOME SHORTCUTS 
Take 5 minutes off your prep
time by using a 28-oz can of diced tomatoes instead of
fresh. (Don't drain them—just toss the whole can in the pot in
step 2.) And while fresh herbs really make a flavor difference
here, if you’re short on time, substitute 1/2 tsp each of


## Notes

This meal is just begging to be spooned
over vegetable noodles. Serve over
Roasted Spaghetti Squash (page
294), zucchini noodles (page 244), or
use your spiral slicer and steam some
sweet potato or carrot noodles.
