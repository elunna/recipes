Yield: 

## Ingredients
2 tablespoons cooking fat
1/2 cup diced onions
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon minced fresh oregano
1 teaspoon fresh thyme
3 cups diced seeded tomatoes (about

2. Add the onions, garlic, oregano, and thyme and cook until
the onions are translucent and the garlic is fragrant, 2 to

30 seconds to incorporate, and serve immediately.
