# lemongrass chicken skewers
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
- 2 tbsp coconut oil
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 1 cup roughly chopped trimmed lemongrass
- 2 tbsp chopped green onions
- 1 1/2 tsp grated fresh ginger
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- Juice of 1/2 lime
- 1/2 lb boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut into 1-inch strips
- 1 tbsp cooking fat (melted, if necessary}
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper

## Instructions
1. If using wooden skewers, soak them in water for 30 minutes to 1 hour to prevent them from burning.
2. **TO make the marinade**, heat the coconut oil and sesame oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  When the oil is hot, add the lemongrass, green onions, ginger, and garlic and cook, stirring, for 1 minute to release the flavor. Remove from the heat and stir in the lime juice. Allow the pan to cool for 5 minutes.
3. Place the chicken strips in a glass storage dish or plastic bag and pour the marinade over the chicken. Seal the bag or cover the dish and marinate the chicken at room temperature for at least 20 minutes, or in the refrigerator overnight.
4. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
5. Line a baking sheet with foil.
6. Remove the chicken from the refrigerator and discard the excess marinade.
7. Cut the marinated chicken into 1-inch pieces and thread onto the skewers. 
8. Arrange the skewers on the baking sheet, brush with the cooking fat, and season with salt and pepper. 
9. Bake for 8 to 12 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through and no pink remains in the center of the strips. 
10. Serve as an appetizer.

If you can’t find lemongrass at your local Asian market, don’t stress. Just double the ginger and add the zest from one lime.
