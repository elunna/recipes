# lemongrass chicken skewers
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
2 tablespoons coconut oil
1 teaspoon sesame oil
1 cup roughly chopped trimmed lemongrass
2 tablespoons chopped green onions
1 1/2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger
1 clove garlic, minced
Juice of 1/2 lime
1/2 pound boneless, skinless chicken breast,
cut into 1-inch strips
1 tablespoon cooking fat (melted, if necessary}
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper

## Instructions
1. IF using wooden skewers, soak them in water for
30 minutes to 1 hour to prevent them from burning.
2. **TO make the marinade**, heat the coconut oil and
sesame oil ina large skillet over medium heat.
When the oil is hot, add the lemongrass, green
onions, ginger, and garlic and cook, stirring, for
1 minute to release the flavor. Remove from the
heat and stir in the lime juice. Allow the pan to
cool for 5 minutes.
3. PLACE the chicken strips in a glass storage dish
or plastic bag and pour the marinade over the
chicken. Seal the bag or cover the dish and mari-
nate the chicken at room temperature for at least
20 minutes, or in the refrigerator overnight.
4. PREHEAT the oven to 350°F. Line a baking
sheet with foil.
5. REMOVE the chicken from the refrigerator and
discard the excess marinade.
6. CUT the marinated chicken into 1-inch pieces
and thread onto the skewers. 
7. Arrange the skew-
ers on the baking sheet, brush with the cooking
fat, and season with salt and pepper. 
8. Bake for
8 to 12 minutes, until the chicken is cooked
through and no pink remains in the center of the
strips. 
9. Serve as an appetizer.


IF YOU can’t find lemongrass at your local
Asian market, don’t stress. Just double the ginger
and add the zest from one lime.
