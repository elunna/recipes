- 1⁄4 tsp cayenne pepper

3. Combine spices (except garam masala) and toss chicken pieces until well coated.

7. Serve over rice and garnish with cilantro if desired.

## Notes

"This recipe tastes great and isn't complicated to make. Perfect served over rice with naan bread for dipping. Garnish with some fresh cilantro if desired."
