# Broiled Salmon With Scallions and Sesame
---
Yield: 3 servings

## Ingredients
2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
3 tbsp fresh lime juice
2 tbsp soy sauce
2 tsp honey
1 tbsp plus 2 tsp vegetable oil
1/2 tsp sesame seeds, plus more for serving
3 8-oz skin-on center-cut salmon fillets
Kosher salt
1 bunch scallions
1 Fresno chile, thinly sliced

## Instructions
1. Whisk garlic, lime juice, soy sauce, honey, 1 Tbsp. oil, and 1/2 tsp. sesame seeds in a small bowl. Season salmon fillets with salt and place in a resealable plastic bag; add half of marinade. Seal bag, pressing out air, and let salmon sit 30 minutes. Reserve remaining marinade.
2. Preheat broiler. Toss scallions with remaining 2 tsp. oil on sizzle platter; broil until lightly charred, about 3 minutes. Remove salmon from marinade and set on top of scallions. Spoon some reserved marinade over and broil until salmon is charred around edges, about 6 minutes (watch closely to keep from burning). Spoon more marinade over; top with chile. Broil until salmon is charred and medium-rare at thickest part, about 2 minutes. Sprinkle with more sesame seeds.


## Notes
If you donâ€™t want to invest in a sizzle platter, you can also make this recipe using a rimmed baking sheet.
