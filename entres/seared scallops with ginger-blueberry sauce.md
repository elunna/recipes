# seared scallops with ginger-blueberry sauce
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
### FOR THE GINGER-BLUEBERRY SAUCE
1 cup fresh or frozen blueberries
1 1/2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh ginger
1/4 teaspoon salt

### FOR THE SCALLOPS
3/4 pound sea scallops, patted dry
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
3 tablespoons cooking fat

## Instructions
### TO MAKE THE GINGER-BLUEBERRY SAUCE: 
1. Defrost your blueberries (if neces-
sary), then combine with 1 cup of water in a
small saucepan over medium-high heat. 
2. Let
the mixture reach a boil, then add the ginger
and salt. 
3. Reduce the heat to medium and cook
for 5 minutes, letting the blueberries burst and
release their juice and the ginger steep.
4. The sauce can be left chunky, but it looks pret-
tier if you blend it in a food processor or with an
immersion blender to a smooth consistency. Just
return it to the pan after blending to keep warm.


### TO MAKE THE SCALLOPS:
1. Season both sides
evenly with the salt and pepper. 
2. Heat the cook-
ing fat in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
3. When the fat is hot, add the scallops in a single
layer (you may need to cook them in batches).
4. Cook until the scallops begin to pull away from
pan and brown, 2 to 3 minutes. 
5. Using kitchen
tongs, turn the scallops and repeat the searing
on the other side, for another 2 minutes.
6. TRANSFER the scallops to a serving dish
or individual plates. Top with 1/4 to 1/2 cup of
the blueberry sauce. Serve warm or at room
temperature.
