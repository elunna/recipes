# chicken meatballs
---
Yield: 2 servings

## Ingredients
- 1 lb ground chicken thigh
- 1 large egg, beaten
- 1/4 onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tsp minced fresh oregano (or 1 tsp dried oregano)
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 2 tbsp cooking fat, plus more if needed

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
2. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
3. Thoroughly mix the chicken, egg, onion, garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper in a large bowl.
4. Roll into 15 to 20 meatballs, each about the size of a golf ball.
5. Melt the cooking fat in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When the fat is hot, add the meatballs (depending on the size of your pan, you may have to do this in batches).
6. Cook for about 30 seconds per side, turning to prevent burning, until browned all over, about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat and add more cooking fat if the pan begins to smoke.
7. Transfer the meatballs to the prepared baking sheet.  Transfer to the oven to finish cooking for 8 to 10 minutes, until the internal temperature reaches 160°F.
8. Let the meatballs rest for 5 minutes and serve.

### MAKE IT A MEAL:
Pair these meatballs with Roasted Red Pepper Sauce, Tomato Sauce, or Pesto, and serve over Roasted Spaghetti Squash or on top of our Ratatouille.

## Notes

VEGETABLE “SPAGHETTI” Meatballs are just begging to be placed over a pile of noodles. Did you know you can make “noodles” out of many vegetables if you have the right tools?  A julienne peeler is great for softer vegetables like cucumber or zucchini (see our Romesco Garlic Shrimp with Zucchini Noodles, but it can be a little time-consuming to prepare large batches. A spiral slicer can turn nearly anything—potatoes, carrots, parsnips, even apples—into thin, spaghetti-like strings, and the process is so fun your kids (or partner) will actually want to participate. Just whip up a batch of your favorite “noodles,” leave raw or steam until they’re al dente (check often by tasting, as you don’t want soggy noodles), and serve.

While it’s not necessary, if you stock grain-free flours in your pantry, you could add 1/4 cup of almond flour or 2 tbsp of coconut flour to your meat mixture to make your meatballs more dense in texture. Change the flavor of this dish by swapping out the oregano for fresh rosemary, sage, or thyme. Or add 2 tbsp of your favorite hot sauce to the mixture and serve with our Ranch Dressing. These also reheat like a dream, so double the batch and enjoy for a few extra meals.
