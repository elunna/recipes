# chicken meatballs
---
Yield: 2 servings

## Ingredients
- 1 lb ground chicken thigh
- 1 large egg, beaten
- 1/4 onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tsp minced fresh oregano (or 1 tsp dried oregano)
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 2 tbsp cooking fat, plus more if needed

## Instructions
1. PREHEAT the oven to 350°F. Line a baking sheet with
parchment paper.
2. THOROUGHLY mix the chicken, egg, onion, garlic,
oregano, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Roll into 15 to 20
meatballs, each about the size of a golf ball.
3. MELT the cooking fat in a large skillet over medium-high
heat. When the fat is hot, add the meatballs (depending on
the size of your pan, you may have to do this in batches).
Cook for about 30 seconds per side, turning to prevent burn-
ing, until browned all over, about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat
and add more cooking fat if the pan begins to smoke.
4. TRANSFER the meatballs to the prepared baking sheet.
Transfer to the oven to finish cooking for 8 to 10 minutes,
until the internal temperature reaches 160°F. Let the meat-
balls rest for 5 minutes and serve.

MAKE IT A MEAL: Pair these meatballs with Roasted
Red Pepper Sauce (page 316), Tomato Sauce (page 324), or
Pesto (page 315), and serve over Roasted Spaghetti Squash
(page 294) or on top of our Ratatouille (page 288).

## Notes

VEGETABLE “SPAGHETTI” Meatballs are just begging to
be placed over a pile of noodles. Did you know you can make
“noodles” out of many vegetables if you have the right tools?
A julienne peeler is great for softer vegetables like cucumber
or zucchini (see our Romesco Garlic Shrimp with Zucchini
Noodles on page 244), but it can be a little time-consuming
to prepare large batches. A spiral slicer can turn nearly
anything—potatoes, carrots, parsnips, even apples—into thin,
spaghetti-like strings, and the process is so fun your kids
(or partner) will actually want to participate. Just whip up
a batch of your favorite “noodles,” leave raw or steam until
they’re al dente (check often by tasting, as you don’t want
soggy noodles), and serve.

While it’s not necessary, if you stock
grain-free flours in your pantry, you could
add %4 cup of almond flour or
2 tbsp of coconut flour to your
meat mixture to make your meatballs
more dense in texture. Change the flavor
of this dish by swapping out the oregano
for fresh rosemary, sage, or thyme. Or
add 2 tbsp of your favorite hot
sauce to the mixture and serve with
our Ranch Dressing (page 316). These
also reheat like a dream, so double the
batch and enjoy for a few extra meals.
