### PORK SHOULDER 
cuts also include Pork Butt, Boston
Butt, and Picnic Shoulder Roast. These cuts all come from
the same area, but include different sizes and portions of the
shoulder muscles. If you can’t find a cut labeled specifically
“pork shoulder,” any of these cuts would work.
## Notes






If you have leftover pork or if you make
a double batch, freeze the pork in 1-cup
servings so you can easily thaw it for
future meals. You can serve the leftover
pork with our Tangy BBQ sauce (page
322) in lettuce cup, over a salad with our
Latin Vinaigrette (page 330), topped with
fried eggs and Chimichurri (page 306),
or added to a Vegetable Frittata (page
206). If butternut squash isn’t in season,
substitute two diced sweet potatoes.
