- 1/2 lime, juiced
- 1 1/2 lb pork shoulder (boneless)

2. Mix the paprika, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper in a small bowl.
3. Add the lime juice and stir. 
4. Place the pork in a Dutch oven or deep roasting pan and coat all sides of the pork with the spice mixture.
5. Add 1 cup of water and cover tightly with a lid or aluminum foil.
6. Cook in the oven, turning the pork shoulder in the pan every 45 minutes.
7. After 2 hours and 15 minutes, add the butternut squash and 1/2 cup of water to the Dutch oven or pan. 
8. Cook for 30 more minutes, then add the kale and tomatoes.
9. Place back in the oven for 15 minutes more.
10. Remove the pan from the oven and leave covered until you are ready to serve.

## Notes
Pork shoulder cuts also include Pork Butt, Boston Butt, and Picnic Shoulder Roast. These cuts all come from the same area, but include different sizes and portions of the shoulder muscles. If you can’t find a cut labeled specifically “pork shoulder,” any of these cuts would work.

If you have leftover pork or if you make a double batch, freeze the pork in 1-cup servings so you can easily thaw it for future meals. You can serve the leftover pork with our Tangy BBQ sauce in lettuce cup, over a salad with our Latin Vinaigrette, topped with fried eggs and Chimichurri, or added to a Vegetable Frittata. If butternut squash isn’t in season, substitute two diced sweet potatoes.
