# stir-fry chicken
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
- 3 tbsp cooking fat
- 1 lb chicken breast or thighs (boneless, skinless)
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp ginger, grated
- 1 head broccoli florets
- 2 cup mushrooms, sliced
- 2 carrots, julienned
- 1/2 lb green beans, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 2 green onions, minced
- 1/2 lime, juiced©
- 1 tbsp minced fresh cilantro

## Instructions
1. Heat 2 tbsp of the cooking fat in a large skillet over medium heat, swirling to coat the bottom of the pan. 
2. Place the chicken in the pan and sear until the outside is browned and it lifts easily from the bottom of the skillet, about 3 min- utes on each side.
3. Add the garlic and ginger. Cook and stir until aromatic, about 1 minute. 
4. Remove the chicken from the pan and slice into thin strips. Set the sliced chicken aside.
5. Wipe the pan clean and dry.
6. Heat the remaining 1 tbsp of cooking fat in the skillet over medium-high heat. 
7. Add the broccoli, mushrooms, carrots, and green beans and quickly stir-fry until the vegetables begin to soften, 2 to 3 minutes.
8. Add the chicken strips to the pan; mix, and continue to cook for 2-3 minutes until everything is heated through.
9. Top with the green onions, lime juice, and cilantro. Serve immediately.

### CUT YOUR PREP AND COOK TIME 
In half by using pre-cooked chicken or shrimp and replacing the fresh vegetables with a frozen vegetable mix. Let the vegetables thaw in the fridge while you're at work—when it’s time to cook, follow the instructions above, stir-frying until everything is heated through.

## Notes
This simple dish is the perfect base for your favorite dressing or sauce. Double the recipe, select two different dressings, and you've got dinner and tomorrow’s lunch covered.  Hot stir-fry also goes well over a crisp, cold salad. Use your favorite sturdy salad greens (try Boston, Bibb, butter, or romaine), thinly sliced cabbage, or a pre-cut cole slaw mix and top with our Herb Citrus Vinaigrette or Latin Marinade. Want something other than chicken? Try using thinly sliced flank steak or shrimp instead.
