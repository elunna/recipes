### CUT YOUR PREP AND COOK TIME 
in half by using pre-cooked chicken or shrimp and replacing the fresh
vegetables with a frozen vegetable mix. Let the vegetables thaw in
the fridge while you're at work—when it’s time to cook, follow
the instructions above, stir-frying until everything is heated through.

This simple dish is the perfect base for
your favorite dressing or sauce (page
302). Double the recipe, select two
different dressings, and you've got
dinner and tomorrow’s lunch covered.
Hot stir-fry also goes well over a crisp,
cold salad. Use your favorite sturdy
salad greens (try Boston, Bibb, butter,
or romaine), thinly sliced cabbage, or
a pre-cut cole slaw mix and top with
our Herb Citrus Vinaigrette (page 326)
or Latin Marinade (page 330). Want
something other than chicken? Try using
thinly sliced flank steak or shrimp instead.
