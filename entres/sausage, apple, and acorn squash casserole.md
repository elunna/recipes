# sausage, apple, and acorn squash casserole
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients

1 pound Perfect Sausage (page 162)
1 tablespoon cooking fat
2 cups button, crimini, or portabella mushrooms,
thinly sliced
1 cup diced peeled apple
2 cups peeled, seeded, and finely diced acorn squash
1 tablespoon poultry seasoning
1/4 cup pumpkin seeds or chopped pecans
Salt and black pepper

## Instructions
1. PREHEAT the oven to 375'F.
2. HEAT the cooking fat in a medium oven-safe
or cast-iron pan over medium heat. Once the fat
is hot, add the sausage and cook until browned,
about 2 minutes, on each side. 
3. Break the sausage
into bite-size pieces with a wooden spoon, until
the fat begins to release, about 2 minutes. 
4. Add
the mushrooms, apple, and squash and cook until
fork-tender, about 5 minutes. 
5. Add the poultry
seasoning, sprinkle with the pumpkin seeds or
pecans and transfer the pan to the oven. (If you
don’t have an oven-safe pan, transfer the mixture
to a glass baking dish.)
6.  Roast for 10 to 15 minutes,
until the internal temperature of the casserole is
140°F. 
7. Add salt and pepper to taste.
