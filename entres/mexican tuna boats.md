# mexican tuna boats
---
Yield: 2 servings

## Ingredients
- 1 avocado, pitted and peeled
- 2 cans (5 oz each) tuna, drained
- 3 green onions, thinly sliced
- Juice of 1 1/2 limes
- 1/2 jalapeno, minced
- 1 tbsp minced fresh cilantro
- 1/2 tsp chili powder
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/8 tsp black pepper
- 1 head endive, separated into leaves

## Instructions
1. IN a medium sized bowl, mash the avocado with a fork,
leaving it slightly chunky. Add the tuna to the bowl, flaking
it apart with a fork, and mix to combine with the avocado.
Add the onions, juice of 1 lime, jalapeno, cilantro, chili pow-
der, salt, and pepper and mix well.
2. SPOON the tuna mixture into the endive leaves. Sprinkle a
dusting of chili powder. Squeeze the juice from the remain-
ing 1/2 lime over the top and serve.

MAKE IT A MEAL: While there are some greens in this
dish, you’re lacking serious veggie power. Try serving the
lettuce wraps with Roasted Sweet Potatoes (page 296),
Gazpacho (page 276), or raw carrots, bell pepper strips, and
celery with Avocado Mayonnaise (page 310) for dipping.



## Notes

This dish makes for the perfect lunch—just
pack up your tuna in a glass container
and wrap your leaves in a slightly damp
paper towel inside a resealable bag to
keep them crisp. Or, stuff the tuna salad
inside a romaine lettuce leaf, hollowed-
out bell pepper, tomato, or the cucumber
cup from page 234. This dish would
also work with canned chicken or salmon
and would taste amazing with a drizzle
of cool Ranch Dressing (page 316) or
Avocado Mayonnaise (page 310).
