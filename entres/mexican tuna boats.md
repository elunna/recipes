---
Yield: 2 servings

## Ingredients
- 1 avocado, pitted and peeled
- 2 cans (5 oz each) tuna, drained
- 3 green onions, thinly sliced
- Juice of 1 1/2 limes
- 1/2 jalapeno, minced
- 1 tbsp minced fresh cilantro
- 1/2 tsp chili powder
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/8 tsp black pepper
- 1 head endive, separated into leaves

## Instructions
1. In a medium sized bowl, mash the avocado with a fork, leaving it slightly chunky.
2. Add the tuna to the bowl, flaking it apart with a fork, and mix to combine with the avocado.
3. Add the onions, juice of 1 lime, jalapeno, cilantro, chili powder, salt, and pepper and mix well.
4. Spoon the tuna mixture into the endive leaves.
5. Sprinkle a dusting of chili powder.
6. Squeeze the juice from the remaining 1/2 lime over the top and serve.

### MAKE IT A MEAL:
While there are some greens in this dish, you’re lacking serious veggie power. Try serving the lettuce wraps with Roasted Sweet Potatoes, Gazpacho, or raw carrots, bell pepper strips, and celery with Avocado Mayonnaise for dipping.

## Notes
This dish makes for the perfect lunch — just pack up your tuna in a glass container and wrap your leaves in a slightly damp paper towel inside a resealable bag to keep them crisp. Or, stuff the tuna salad inside a romaine lettuce leaf, hollowed- out bell pepper, tomato, or a cucumber cup. This dish would also work with canned chicken or salmon and would taste amazing with a drizzle of cool Ranch Dressing or Avocado Mayonnaise.
