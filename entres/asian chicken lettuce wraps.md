## Ingredients
- 1/2 cup hoisin sauce
- 1/4 cup + 1 tbsp reduced-sodium soy sauce, use tamari to make gluten free
- 2 tbsp rice vinegar
- 2 tsp sesame oil
- 1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 lb ground chicken breast
- 1 small bunch green onions, thinly sliced, white/light green and dark green parts divided
- 1 tbsp freshly grated ginger
- 2 cloves garlic, minced (about 2 tsp)
- 8 oz baby bella cremini mushrooms, finely chopped
- 1 1/2 cup grated carrots, from about 3 large carrots
- 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, reduce to 1/4 tsp or omit if sensitive to spice
- 2 cans water chestnuts, drained and finely chopped, (8 oz cans) drained and finely chopped
- 2 heads butter lettuce

## Instructions
1. Lightly coat a 5-qt or larger slow cooker with nonstick spray. 
2. In a small bowl, stir together the hoisin, soy sauce, rice vinegar, and sesame oil. Set aside.
3. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium high. 
4. Add the chicken and brown the meat, breaking it into small pieces. 
5. Continue cooking until no longer pink, about 4 to 6 minutes. 
6. Stir in the white and light green parts of the green onions, ginger, and garlic. 
7. Cook 30 additional seconds.
8. Transfer the meat mixture to the slow cooker. 
9. Stir in the chopped mushrooms, carrots, red pepper flakes, and sauce. 
10. Cover and cook on LOW for 2 to 3 hours until the mixture is thickened and the chicken is ultra tender. 
11. (Do not be tempted to cook on HIGH, as the chicken will become tough.) 
12. Stir in the water chestnuts and green parts of the green onions.
13. To serve, separate the butter lettuce leaves and fill with the chicken mixture.
