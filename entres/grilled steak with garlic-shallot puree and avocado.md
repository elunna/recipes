# grilled steak with garlic-shallot puree and avocado
---
Yield: 2 servings

## Ingredients
- 2 steaks (5 oz each) for grilling (sirloin, strip, rib eye, tenderloin)
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 2 cloves garlic, peeled
- 1 shallot, peeled
- 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 avocado, split lengthwise, pitted and peeled

## Instructions
1. REMOVE the steaks from the refrigerator 30 minutes
before cooking. Preheat a grill to high heat (6500°F) and the
oven to 350°F. Line a baking sheet with foil.
2. MIX the salt and pepper in a small bowl and use two-thirds
of the mixture to season the steaks.
3. TOSS the garlic and shallot in 1 tbsp of the olive oil
and arrange on the prepared baking sheet. Season evenly
with the remaining salt and pepper. Roast in the oven for
25 minutes, until the cloves are soft throughout. Transfer
the garlic and shallots to a food processor, add the remain-
ing 1 tbsp olive oil, and puree. Transfer the puree to
a dish, cover with foil to keep warm, and set aside.
4. LAY the steaks on the hot grill and sear for 2 to 3 minutes.
The steaks should pull off easily when they are seared. Turn
the steaks over and sear the other side—the second side
doesn’t take as long, 1 to 2 minutes, or to desired done-
ness (see chart on page 154). Let the steaks rest for 5 to 10
minutes.
5. MEANWHILE, sear the avocado halves pitted side down
on the grill until lightly browned, 3 to 4 minutes.
6. Arrange the avocado and steaks on plates and top the steaks with the warm garlic and shallot puree.
7. MAKE IT A MEAL: This flavorful steak goes great with
the Roasted Beet, Orange, and Avocado Salad (page 290)
or Green Beans with Sautéed Onion, Mushrooms, and
Peppers (page 280).
## Notes


Roasting the shallot and garlic imparts a
rich, deep flavor, but you could cut about
20 minutes off your cooking time by
sautéing instead of roasting: First mince
the shallot and garlic. Heat a large
skillet over medium-high heat. Add
1 tbsp cooking fat and swirl to
coat the bottom of the pan. Add the
shatlof and cook unfif fransfucent (2 to
3 minutes), then add the garlic and
cook until aromatic (about 1 minute).
Puree in the blender as directed.
