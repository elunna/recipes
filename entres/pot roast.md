# pot roast
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
- 1 1/2 lb beef roast (chuck, boneless short ribs, brisket, top round, rump)
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1 onion, sliced
- 3 carrots, unpeeled and cut into
- 2-inch pieces
- 3 stalks celery, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1 small butternut squash, peeled and large-diced
- 2 cloves garlic
- 2 sprigs thyme
- 2 cup beef broth or water

## Instructions
1. SET your slow cooker to low heat, and season your roast
with the salt and pepper.
2. ADD the beef roast, onions, carrots, celery, butternut
squash, garlic, and thyme sprigs to the slow cooker. 
3. Top
with the broth or water (or enough to cover the roast half-
way) and leave the roast to cook for 6 to 8 hours. The roast
should be fork-tender when done.
4. REMOVE the roast, transfer to a large plate or serving dish,
and cover with foil. Allow the meat to rest for 15 minutes
before serving.
5. REMOVE the thyme springs from the broth and discard.
6. Slice the roast against the grain. Divide the meat and veg-
etables on individual plates, and ladle broth over the top.




JUST LIKE WOOD, meat also has grainâ€”muscle fiber
bundles that are thicker and more prominent in harder-
working muscle meat like the cuts that go into a beef roast.
Cutting parallel to the grain (along the same lines as the
grain) can make your meat much tougher. Instead, cut
against the grain (perpendicular to those lines), to naturally
soften up the meat and retain a much more tender texture.


## Notes

If you have the time, you can add even
more flavor to your roast by browning the
meat, onions, and carrots before adding to
the slow cooker. Set the slow cooker to low
heat, and season your roast with salt and
pepper. Melt 2 to 3 tbsp of clarified
butter or coconut oil in a large pot (or Dutch
oven) over medium-high heat. Add the
onions and (without stirring), sear them for
1 minute on one side, then flip using a wide
spatula and sear the other side for 1 min-
ute. (Onions should be slightly browned.)
Remove from the pan, add the carrots,
repeating the process, until carrots are also
browned. Add 1 tbsp of cooking
fat, and add the roast to the pan. Sear it
for 1 minute on all sides, until browned.
Follow the rest of the above instructions.
