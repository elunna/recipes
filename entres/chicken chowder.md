# chicken chowder
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp cumin
- 1/4 tsp paprika
- 1/8 tsp cayenne
- 1 lb chicken thighs (boneless)
- 1 qt chicken or vegetable broth
- 2 medium sweet potatoes, 1-inch cubed
- 1 head broccoli cut into 1-inch pieces (save stems)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 jalapefio, finely diced (optional)
- 1 14.5-oz can coconut milk
- 1 tbsp fresh cilantro, minced
- 1 lime, juiced
- 1/2 small red onion, finely chopped

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
2. Mix the salt, cumin, paprika, and cayenne in a small bowl
3. Season the chicken thighs evenly with the spice mixture.
4. Place the chicken in a baking pan and roast for 20 minutes.
5. Remove the chicken from the oven and let it rest for 5 minutes on a cutting board. Cut the chicken into 1-inch cubes.
6. While the chicken is roasting, add the broth to a medium-sized pot. Bring to a boil, then add the sweet potatoes.
7. Cook over high heat until the sweet potatoes are fork-tender, about 10 minutes. Remove the sweet potatoes from the broth with a slotted spoon and set them aside.
8. Add the broccoli stems, garlic, and jalapefio (if you want the extra kick) to the broth. Reduce the heat to medium high and boil for 15 minutes.
9. Add the broccoli florets and coconut milk, and continue to boil until the broccoli is very tender, about 5 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat.
10. Transfer the broth and vegetables from the pot to a food processor or blender and blend until smooth.
11. Place the blended mixture back into the pot and add the cooked chicken, sweet potatoes, and cilantro. Return the pot to medium heat, stir well, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes to reheat the chicken and sweet potatoes.
12. Serve immediately. Garnish the chowder with the fresh lime juice and finely chopped red onion.

You can bring this dish to work for a hot lunch even if you don’t have a microwave. Before you leave for the day, heat the soup on medium-low heat until it’s hot but not boiling, then place in a double-walled thermos. The thermos will keep it hot until lunchtime.

## Notes

Want to add a different flavor to this meal? Try grilling your chicken instead of roasting it, substitute chicken for shrimp or hard-boiled eggs, or use cauliflower instead of broccoli. You can also turn this into a chicken “noodle” or “rice” chowder by adding pre-cooked Cauliflower Rice, Roasted Spaghetti Squash, or zoodles just before the final reheat.
