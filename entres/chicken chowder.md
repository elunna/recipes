Yield: 

## Ingredients
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp cumin
1/4 tsp paprika
1/8 tsp cayenne
1 lb chicken thighs (boneless)
1 qt chicken or vegetable broth
2 medium sweet potatoes, 1-inch cubed
1 head broccoli cut into 1-inch pieces
(save stems)
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 jalapefio, finely diced (optional)
1 14.5-oz can coconut milk
1 tbsp fresh cilantro, minced
1 lime, juiced
1/2 small red onion, finely chopped

## Instructions
1. PREHEAT the oven to 350°F.
2. MIX the salt, cumin, paprika, and cayenne in a small bowl.
Season the chicken thighs evenly with the spice mixture.
Place the chicken in a baking pan and roast for 20 minutes.
Remove the chicken from the oven and let it rest for 5 min-
utes on a cutting board. Cut the chicken into 1-inch cubes.
3. WHILE the chicken is roasting, add the broth to a medium-
sized pot. Bring to a boil, then add the sweet potatoes. Cook
over high heat until the sweet potatoes are fork-tender,
about 10 minutes. Remove the sweet potatoes from the
broth with a slotted spoon and set them aside.
4. ADD the broccoli stems, garlic, and jalapefio (if you want
the extra kick) to the broth. Reduce the heat to medium
high and boil for 15 minutes. Add the broccoli florets and
coconut milk, and continue to boil until the broccoli is very
tender, about 5 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat.
5. TRANSFER the broth and vegetables from the pot to a
food processor or blender and blend until smooth. Place
the blended mixture back into the pot and add the cooked
chicken, sweet potatoes, and cilantro. Return the pot to
medium heat, stir well, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes to
reheat the chicken and sweet potatoes. Serve immediately.
6. GARNISH the chowder with the fresh lime juice and finely
chopped red onion.

## Notes

Want to add a different flavor to this
meal? Try grilling your chicken instead
of roasting it, substitute chicken for
shrimp or hard-boiled eggs, or use
cauliflower instead of broccoli. You can
also turn this into a chicken “noodle” or
“rice” chowder by adding pre-cooked
Cauliflower Rice (page 272), Roasted
Spaghetti Squash (page 294), or zoodles
(page 244) just before the final reheat.
