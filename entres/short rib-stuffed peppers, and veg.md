# short rib-stuffed peppers, sun-dried tomatoes, portabella mushrooms, and anchovies
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients

- 4 portabella mushroom caps, stems removed
- 1/2 cup Balsamic Vinaigrette
- 1 cup balsamic vinegar
- 8 bell peppers (red, yellow, or orange)
- 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- Braised Beef Short Ribs
- 2 cup sun-dried tomatoes in oil
- 2 cup Kalamata or black olives, pitted
- 4 oz anchovies in oil, drained
- 2 tbsp capers, drained
- 1 tsp coarse salt

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 450°F.
2. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a shallow dish or plastic re-sealable bag, marinate the mushroom caps in the prepared balsamic vinaigrette for 30 minutes at room temperature.
3. While the mushrooms are marinating, **prepare the balsamic glaze**: bring the balsamic vinegar to a boil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Turn the heat down to medium low and simmer until reduced by about half, about 20-30 minutes. Remove from the heat, allow to cool, and reserve. It should be thick enough to stick to your spoon, but still easy to drizzle. (You can do this step up to a week ahead of time; store in a covered container at room temperature.)
4. In a large mixing bowl, coat the bell peppers with the olive oil, and place on the prepared baking sheet.
5. Roast in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes, turning once during cooking, until the skins are wrinkled and charred. Transfer the peppers to a bowl and cover with aluminum foil.
6. Allow the peppers to cool for 30 minutes.
7. While the peppers are cooling, reduce the oven heat to 350°F.
8. Remove the mushroom caps from the marinade and discard the vinaigrette.
9. Using the same lined baking sheet, roast the mushrooms in the oven for 10 minutes, then flip them over and roast for another 10 minutes, until the center is soft.
10. Let cool, then slice into strips.
11. Rub the charred skin off the peppers, leaving just the roasted flesh. Remove the stems and seeds, and cut each pepper into four equal quarters.
12. Fill each pepper quarter with a spoonful of short ribs, wrap the pepper around the meat, and secure with a toothpick.
13. Arrange the stuffed peppers, roasted mushroom strips, sun-dried tomatoes, olives, and anchovies on one or more serving dishes.
14. Drizzle a very thin stream of the balsamic glaze over the stuffed peppers and mushrooms.
15. Sprinkle with the capers and coarse salt and serve warm or cold.
