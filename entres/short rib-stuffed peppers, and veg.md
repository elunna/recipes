# short rib-stuffed peppers, sun-dried tomatoes, portabella mushrooms, and anchovies
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients

4 portabella mushroom caps, stems removed
1/2 cup Balsamic Vinaigrette (page 328)
1 cup balsamic vinegar
8 bell peppers (red, yellow, or orange)
1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
Braised Beef Short Ribs (page 371)
2 cups sun-dried tomatoes in oil
2 cups Kalamata or black olives, pitted
4 ounces anchovies in oil, drained
2 tablespoons capers, drained
1 teaspoon coarse salt

## Instructions
1. PREHEAT the oven to 450°F. Line a baking
sheet with parchment paper.
2. IN a shallow dish or plastic re-sealable bag, mari-
nate the mushroom caps in the prepared balsamic
vinaigrette for 30 minutes at room temperature.
3. WHILE the mushrooms are marinating, prepare
the balsamic glaze: bring the balsamic vinegar
to a boil in a small saucepan over medium-high
heat. Turn the heat down to medium low and
simmer until reduced by about half, about 20 to
30 minutes. Remove from the heat, allow to cool,
and reserve. It should be thick enough to stick
to your spoon, but still easy to drizzle. (You can
do this step up to a week ahead of time; store in
a covered container at room temperature.)
4. IN a large mixing bowl, coat the bell peppers
with the olive oil, and place on the prepared
baking sheet. Roast in the oven for 30 to 40
minutes, turning once during cooking, until the
skins are wrinkled and charred. Transfer the
peppers to a bowl and cover with aluminum foil.
Allow the peppers to cool for 30 minutes.
5. WHILE the peppers are cooling, reduce the
oven heat to 350°F. Remove the mushroom caps
from the marinade and discard the vinaigrette.
Using the same lined baking sheet, roast the
mushrooms in the oven for 10 minutes, then
flip them over and roast for another 10 minutes,
until the center is soft. Let cool, then slice into
strips.
6. RUB the charred skin off the peppers, leaving
just the roasted flesh. Remove the stems and
seeds, and cut each pepper into four equal quar-
ters. Fill each pepper quarter with a spoonful
of short ribs, wrap the pepper around the meat,
and secure with a toothpick.
7. ARRANGE the stuffed peppers, roasted mush-
room strips, sun-dried tomatoes, olives, and
anchovies on one or more serving dishes.
Drizzle a very thin stream of the balsamic
glaze over the stuffed peppers and mushrooms.
Sprinkle with the capers and coarse salt and
serve warm or cold.
