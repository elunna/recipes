# cod with mushroom and red pepper relish
---
Yield: 2 servings

## Ingredients
- 1 lb cod
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- 2 tbsp cooking fat
- 1/4 onion, finely chopped
- 2 tsp grated fresh ginger (or 1/2 tsp ground ginger)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 pt (2 cup) button, cremini, or portabella mushrooms, sliced
- 1 cup roasted red peppers, chopped


## Instructions
1. PREHEAT the oven to 350°F. Line a baking pan or glass
baking dish with parchment paper.
2. CUT the fish into portions and gently pat dry with a paper
towel. Season evenly with 1/4 tsp of the salt and 1/8 tea-
spoon of the pepper and place in the baking pan. Bake for
12 to 15 minutes, until the flesh in the center of the fish no
longer appears wet or spongy in texture when you pierce it
with a fork. It’s done when it just barely starts to flake when
pulled apart.
3. WHILE the fish is cooking, add the cooking fat to a large
skillet over medium heat. When the fat is hot, add the
onion and cook, stirring, until the onion is translucent,
2 to 3 minutes. Add the ginger and stir for 30 seconds.
Add the garlic and stir until aromatic, about 1 minute. Add
the mushrooms and continue to cook, stirring, for 1 to 2
minutes. The mushrooms will release moisture, bringing
the flavors together, and then become more dry in appear-
ance. Add the roasted red peppers and the remaining 1/4
tsp salt and 1/8 tsp pepper and stir for 2 min-
utes, allowing the peppers to warm. Remove the pan from
the heat and hold covered to keep warm.
4. REMOVE the fish from the oven, spoon the mushroom and
pepper mixture generously over the top of the fish, and
serve immediately

MAKE IT A MEAL: This dish goes beautifully with a
simple green salad dressed with our Balsamic Vinaigrette
(page 328) and either roasted butternut squash (see page
166-167) or a simple Cauliflower Mash (page 270).


## Notes

This dish isn’t in our Fancypants Meal
section, but it’s beautiful enough to wow
guests. Plus, our pairing suggestion of
roasted squash can cook at 350°F, so
your oven can easily pull double duty. The
squash will take about an hour to roast at
this temperature (assuming a large dice),
so put it in the oven about 45 minutes
before you start cooking the fish. Or, start
your cauliflower steaming just before you
start prepping the fish—it should be done
and ready to blend in the food processor
as the fish is coming out of the oven. Make
your dressing ahead of time and throw
together a salad while the fish cooks and
you’ve got a company-worthy meal.
