# braised beef short ribs
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
- 3 tsp salt
- 2 tsp black pepper
- 3 lb beef short ribs, trimmed
- 4 to 6 tbsp cooking fat
- 1 onion, quartered
- 6 cloves garlic, peeled
- 4 sprigs fresh thyme
- 2 cup apple cider

## Instructions
1. MIX 2 tsp of the salt and all the pepper
in a small bowl and use to season the short ribs
evenly on both sides.
2. IN an oven-safe heavy pot or Dutch oven, melt
4 tbsp of the cooking fat over medium-
high heat. 
3. When the fat is hot, sear the short
ribs until each side is golden brown, about 1
minute on each side. (You'll likely have to do
this in batches, adding another tbsp of
cooking fat to each new batch.)
4. TRANSFER all the ribs to a slow cooker, 
5. Add the
onion, garlic, thyme, apple cider, and 8 cup of
water and cook on low for 8 hours. When done,
the short ribs should be fork-tender.
6. TRANSFER the short ribs to a bowl and shred,
discarding the bones and excess fat.
7.  Ladle the
cooking liquid, onion, and garlic into a food
processor or blender, removing the thyme
stems, and blend on low until thoroughly mixed.

8. Transfer the blended sauce to a medium sauce-
pot and bring to a simmer over medium heat.

9. Cook until thickened, about 5 minutes. Season
the sauce with the remaining 1 tsp salt.
10. TRANSFER the shredded short ribs to a serving
bowl, toss with the sauce, and reserve. (You'll be
using all of it to stuff the peppers for your tapas
plate.)
