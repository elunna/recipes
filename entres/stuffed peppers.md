# stuffed peppers
---
Yield: 2 servings

## Ingredients
4 red, yellow, or orange bell peppers
(preferably round in shape)
3 tbsp cooking fat
1/4 cup finely chopped onion
2 cloves garlic, minced (or 1 tsp
garlic powder)
4 kale leaves, stems removed, leaves
finely chopped
1 lb ground meat (beef, lamb, bison)
2 tbsp tomato paste
1/4 tsp cumin
1/4 tsp chili powder
1/2 tsp salt
1/4 tsp black pepper
1 cup finely chopped peeled winter
squash (butternut, acorn, etc.)

## Instructions
1. PREHEAT the oven to 350°F. Line a deep baking dish with
parchment paper.
2. WITH a paring knife, slice around the top of each bell
pepper and gently pull up on the stem. Discard the seeded
core. Place the peppers in the prepared dish. Bake for 10
minutes, until softened. Set aside.
3. MEANWHILE, melt the cooking fat in a large skillet over
medium heat and swirl to coat the bottom. When the fat is
hot, add the onion and cook, stirring with a wooden spoon,
until translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the garlic and con-
tinue to cook until aromatic, about 1 minute. Add the kale
and cook for 1 minute, stirring. Add the ground meat and
cook, breaking up the meat with a spatula or wooden spoon
and stirring it into the vegetables, for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir
in the tomato paste, cumin, chili powder, salt, and pepper.
Cook until the meat is mostly browned, 7 to 9 minutes. Stir
in the squash and cook until the squash is slightly softened,
2 to 3 minutes.

4. DIVIDE the meat and squash mixture evenly among the
softened bell peppers. Return to the oven and bake for 10
minutes, until the peppers look wrinkly and the beef is
slightly browned on top.

STABILIZING PEPPERS If your peppers won’t stay upright
in the pan, gently slice across the bottom to create a flat
surface. Only skim the bottom of the pepper with your knife,
however—you don’t want to cut too much away and create a
hole for the meat and juices to leak through.

## Notes

This dish just begs you to use up all of
the leftover vegetables you have in your
fridge. Add some chopped mushrooms,
spinach, cauliflower, or broccoli in place
of or in addition to the kale. The more
vegetables you add to the mix, the
more peppers you'll need to hold all
that stuffing, so buy one or two extra
just in case—or enjoy any filling that
doesn’t fit in the peppers on top of a
salad or in a bowl drizzled with some
Pesto (page 315) or Ranch Dressing
(page 316) for lunch the next day.
