# baby back ribs with tangy bbq sauce
---
Yield: 2 servings

## Ingredients
2 pounds baby back ribs
1 cup chicken broth (page 177) or water
2 cups Tangy BBQ Sauce (page 322)

### FOR THE RUB
2 tablespoons dried oregano
1 teaspoon mustard powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon black pepper


## Instructions
1. MAKE THE RUB: Mix the oregano, mustard powder, onion
powder, garlic powder, paprika, cumin, salt, and pepper ina
small bowl. Set the ribs flesh-side up on a large piece of foil
and coat evenly with the rub. Marinate in the refrigerator
for 3 to 24 hours (the longer the better).
2. PREHEAT the oven to 300°F.
3. PLACE the ribs in a casserole or glass baking dish. Pour the
chicken broth or water into the dish and cover with foil. Bake
for 1 hour, or until the meat pulls back from the rib bones.
4. PREHEAT a grill to medium heat (350°F). Place the ribs
1 teaspoon onion powderdirectly over the heat and grill until nicely charred, 6 to 8
minutes on each side. If you don’t have a grill, increase the
oven temperature to 475°F and cook the ribs for 10 minutes
on each side.
5. REMOVE the ribs from the grill or oven and immediately
baste generously with the BBQ sauce. Serve with the
remaining sauce.

### MAKE IT A MEAL: 
This recipe goes great with a serving
of Butternut Squash with Kale and Swiss Chard (page 268),
Green Cabbage Slaw (page 282), or Roasted Sweet Potatoes
(page 296).

## Notes

Cut your prep in half by making the BBQ
Sauce up to two days ahead of time.

### WHEN ARE THE RIBS DONE? 
While you should cook ribs
to 180° to 190°F, a meat thermometer is not much help here: It
is very hard to get an accurate reading because the bones get
in the way of measuring the temperature. A few ways to test
whether your ribs are done: Pick up the slab with a pair of tongs
and bounce them slightly. If they are ready, the slab will bow
and be close to breaking. You can also poke a toothpick into
the meat between the bones. When it slides in with little or no
resistance (like with baked goods) your ribs are ready.
