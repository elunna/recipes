# dry-rubbed grilled steak
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
3 tbsp salt
2 tbsp paprika
2 tsp dried oregano
2 tsp ground mustard
2 tsp onion powder
2 tsp black pepper
1 tsp ground turmeric
1 tsp garlic powder
1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
4 steaks (5 to 8 oz each) for grilling
(sirloin, strip, rib eye, tenderloin)

## Instructions
1. TO make the dry rub, mix all the seasonings
together in a small bowl. Reserve 2 tbsp
and store the rest in an airtight container. 
2. SEASON each steak evenly on both sides using
1 1/2 tsp of the dry rub. Let the steaks mari-
nate at room temperature for 15 to 30 minutes.
3. WHILE the steaks are marinating, preheat the
grill to high heat (500°F) and the oven to 350°F.
4. LAY the steaks on the hot grill at a 45-degree
angle to the grates. Let the steaks sear for
2 to 3 minutes—you'll know a steak is ready to
move when it pulls off the grates easily.
5.  When
ready, use grill tongs to turn the steaks
90 degrees, and sear for 2 more minutes.
This creates a nice pattern of grill marks on
the steaks. 
6. Flip the steaks and repeat the two-
step searing process on the other side.
7. TRANSFER the steaks to a baking sheet or cast-
iron skillet. Place the baking sheet or skillet in
the oven and bake for 8 to 12 minutes, depend-
ing on the thickness of the steak and the desired
temperature (see page 154 for guidelines). Use a
meat thermometer until you learn how to judge
this by the look and feel of the steak. Remember
to pull the steak out of the oven when it’s 5°F
below the desired temperature, as it will con-
tinue to cook as it rests.
8. LET the steaks rest at room temperature for
5 minutes before serving.



## Notes

Good
news—you can make this weeks ahead of time.
Feel free to double the recipe and save more of
the rub for the next time you grill.
