# dry-rubbed grilled steak
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
- 3 tbsp salt
- 2 tbsp paprika
- 2 tsp dried oregano
- 2 tsp ground mustard
- 2 tsp onion powder
- 2 tsp black pepper
- 1 tsp ground turmeric
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
- 4 steaks (5 to 8 oz each) for grilling (sirloin, strip, rib eye, tenderloin)

## Instructions
1. To make the dry rub, mix all the seasonings together in a small bowl. Reserve 2 tbsp and store the rest in an airtight container. 
2. Season each steak evenly on both sides using 1 1/2 tsp of the dry rub. Let the steaks marinate at room temperature for 15 to 30 minutes.
3. While the steaks are marinating, preheat the grill to high heat (500°F) and the oven to 350°F.
4. Lay the steaks on the hot grill at a 45-degree angle to the grates. Let the steaks sear for 2 to 3 minutes — you'll know a steak is ready to
move when it pulls off the grates easily.
5. When ready, use grill tongs to turn the steaks 90 degrees, and sear for 2 more minutes.  This creates a nice pattern of grill marks on
the steaks. 
6. Flip the steaks and repeat the two-step searing process on the other side.
7. Transfer the steaks to a baking sheet or cast-iron skillet. Place the baking sheet or skillet in the oven and bake for 8 to 12 minutes, depend- ing on the thickness of the steak and the desired temperature. Use a meat thermometer until you learn how to judge this by the look and feel of the steak. Remember to pull the steak out of the oven when it’s 5°F below the desired temperature, as it will continue to cook as it rests.
8. Let the steaks rest at room temperature for 5 minutes before serving.

## Notes

Good news — you can make this weeks ahead of time.  Feel free to double the recipe and save more of the rub for the next time you grill.
