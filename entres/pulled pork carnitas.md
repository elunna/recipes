# pulled pork carnitas
---
Yield: 2 servings

## Ingredients
1 1/2 tablespoons salt
1 teaspoon black pepper
2 pounds pork butt, cut into 4-inch cubes
2 tablespoons cooking fat
1/2 medium onion, roughly chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon chili powder
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 cup sliced (1/2-inch pieces) green onions
Juice of 1/2 lime

## Instructions
1. PREHEAT the oven to 350°F.
2. MIX 1 tablespoon of the salt and all of the pepper in a bowl.
Use to season the pork butt evenly.
3. IN a heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium heat, melt the
cooking fat, swirling to coat the bottom of the pan. When
the fat is hot, add the pork (be sure not to overcrowd) and
brown all sides, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove the pork
from the pot and set aside.
4. IN the same pot, reduce the heat to medium-low, add the onion, and cook, stirring, until translucent, 4 to 5 minutes.
Add the garlic and cook, stirring vigorously to prevent burn-
ing, until aromatic, about 1 minute. Add 1 cup of water, the
chili powder, and cinnamon. Increase the heat to medium
high, return the pork to the pot, and bring to a boil.
5. COVER the pot with a lid or tightly wrapped foil. Transfer to
the oven and bake for 2 1/2 hours, turning the meat after each
hour. The pork should be fork-tender when done.
6. TRANSFER the pork to a bowl and shred with a fork or two,
discarding any excess fat. Incorporate the cooking liquid
from the pot, then add the green onions and lime juice.
Season with the remaining 1/2 tablespoon salt.


### MAKE IT A MEAL: 
Turn your carnitas into a taco salad by
serving over crisp greens along with Salsa (page 319) and
Guacamole (page 308); serve with Green Cabbage Slaw
(page 282) drizzled with Ranch Dressing (page 316).

### CUTS FOR PULLED PORK 
Pork butt is the most common
cut used for pulled pork because it is marbled with flavor-
enhancing fat. It’s also known as Boston butt, Boston shoulder,
and pork shoulder roast. If you get a cut with the bone, throw it
in the pot with the meat and let the nutrients and fat from the
bone infuse your carnitas.

## Notes


Make your evening easier by letting your
slow cooker do the cooking. Before you
leave for the day, complete the recipe
through the fourth step (just before
transferring the pot to the oven). At that
point, just put everything in the slow
cooker. Set the cooker on low and let
it cook all day (8 to 10 hours). When
you get home, not only will your house
smell amazing, but you'll have the
ultimate ready-to-eat, pull-apart pork!
