# pulled pork carnitas
---
Yield: 2 servings

## Ingredients
- 1 1/2 tbsp salt
- 1 tsp black pepper
- 2 lb pork butt, cut into 4-inch cubes
- 2 tbsp cooking fat
- 1/2 medium onion, roughly chopped
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 tsp chili powder
- 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1/4 cup sliced (1/2-inch pieces) green onions
- Juice of 1/2 lime

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
2. Mix 1 tbsp of the salt and all of the pepper in a bowl.  Use to season the pork butt evenly.
3. In a heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium heat, melt the cooking fat, swirling to coat the bottom of the pan. When the fat is hot, add the pork (be sure not to overcrowd) and brown all sides, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove the pork from the pot and set aside.
4. In the same pot, reduce the heat to medium-low, add the onion, and cook, stirring, until translucent, 4 to 5 minutes.
5. Add the garlic and cook, stirring vigorously to prevent burning, until aromatic, about 1 minute.
6. Add 1 cup of water, the chili powder, and cinnamon.
7. Increase the heat to medium high, return the pork to the pot, and bring to a boil.
8. Cover the pot with a lid or tightly wrapped foil. Transfer to the oven and bake for 2 1/2 hours, turning the meat after each hour. The pork should be fork-tender when done.
9. Transfer the pork to a bowl and shred with a fork or two, discarding any excess fat.
10. Incorporate the cooking liquid from the pot, then add the green onions and lime juice
11. Season with the remaining 1/2 tbsp salt.

### MAKE IT A MEAL: 
Turn your carnitas into a taco salad by serving over crisp greens along with Salsa and Guacamole; serve with Green Cabbage Slaw drizzled with Ranch Dressing.

### CUTS FOR PULLED PORK 
Pork butt is the most common cut used for pulled pork because it is marbled with flavor- enhancing fat. It’s also known as Boston butt, Boston shoulder, and pork shoulder roast. If you get a cut with the bone, throw it in the pot with the meat and let the nutrients and fat from the bone infuse your carnitas.

## Notes
Make your evening easier by letting your slow cooker do the cooking. Before you leave for the day, complete the recipe through the fourth step (just before transferring the pot to the oven). At that point, just put everything in the slow cooker. Set the cooker on low and let it cook all day (8 to 10 hours). When you get home, not only will your house smell amazing, but you'll have the ultimate ready-to-eat, pull-apart pork!
