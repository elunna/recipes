# Baked Cod
---
Yield: 4 servings

## Ingredients
- 1-2 tbsp cooking fat
- 2 tbsp unsalted butter, melted
- 1 tbsp lemon juice, freshly squeezed
- 1 tbsp fresh garlic - minced
- 1 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt - or 1/2 tsp of any other salt, including Morton kosher salt
- 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
- 2 tbsp capers - drained
- 4 cod fillets - 6 oz each, 1 inch thick, fresh or frozen
- 1/2 tsp paprika

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 425°F. Melt the cooking fat.
2. In a small bowl, whisk the butter, lemon juice, garlic, salt, and red pepper flakes. Stir in the capers.
3. Place the cod fillets in the baking dish. Pour the butter mixture on top. Use a brush to evenly distribute the thick sauce on top of the fillets. Sprinkle them with paprika.
4. Bake uncovered until the fish is fully cooked, opaque, and flakes easily with a fork. Depending on the thickness of your cod fillets and your oven, this should take about 15 minutes (25 minutes if using frozen fish). Serve immediately.

Notes
- This recipe works well with other firm-fleshed white fish, such as halibut, as long as the fillets are thick - about 1 inch thick. Thinner fillets will require a shorter time in the oven.
- There's no need to cover the fish. You should bake it uncovered. 
- If using frozen fillets, use olive oil instead of butter, as the butter quickly hardens on a frozen fillet.
- The best way to ensure the cod is done is to use an instant-read thermometer, aiming for an internal temperature of 145°F. Another way to check for doneness is to use a fork to gently flake the top of one of the fillets. When the fish is done, the flesh is opaque, and you can easily separate it with a fork. As long as the fish is undercooked, its flesh will resist flaking.
- You can keep the leftovers in a sealed container in the fridge for up to three days. Reheat them gently - you don't want them to dry out. It's best to reheat them in the microwave, covered, at 50% power.

## Notes

This moist and tender baked cod is topped with a lemony, buttery topping that doesn't overpower the delicate fish. Ready in less than 30 minutes, it's one of the fish recipes most often requested by my family.
