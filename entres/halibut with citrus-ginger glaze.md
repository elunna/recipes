# halibut with citrus-ginger glaze
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
### FOR THE GLAZE
- 1/2 cup apple cider
- Grated zest and juice of 2 lemons
- Juice of 1 orange
- 1/2 tbsp grated fresh ginger (or 1/2 tsp ground ginger)

### FOR THE FISH
- 3 tbsp cooking fat
- 2 halibut fillets (5 oz each)
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper

## Instructions
1. PREHEAT the oven to 400°F.
2. FOR THE GLAZE: Cook the apple cider in a small
saucepan over medium-high heat until reduced to about
1 tbsp, 4 to 6 minutes. Add the lemon juice, orange
juice, and ginger and cook until reduced by half, 3 to 5
minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and add the lemon
zest. Set aside.
3. FOR THE FISH: Heat 2 tbsp of the cooking fat in
a large skillet over high heat, swirling to coat the bottom
of the pan. While the fat is heating, season the halibut with
the salt and pepper. When the fat is hot, place the fish top-
side-down in the pan and sear for 2 to 3 minutes. While the
fish is searing, melt the remaining 1 tbsp cooking fat
(if necessary), line a baking sheet with parchment paper,
and brush half of the fat on the paper.
4. REMOVE the halibut from the pan and transfer seared-
side-up to the greased, lined baking sheet. Brush the
remaining cooking fat over the top of the halibut. Bake in
the oven for 10 to 12 minutes, until the flesh is just barely
Halibut is delicious, but it can also
be expensive. You can substitute a
variety of white fish here—try cod,
turbot, dogfish, haddock, or striped
bass. If you don’t want to juice
the orange by hand, substitute
cup store-bought orange juice.
firm and flakes easily with a fork. Transfer the fish to a serv-
ing dish or individual plates and spoon the glaze over the
top just before serving.

### HALIBUT 
Halibut and other white fish are a little tricky
to cook; there is very little oil in halibut, so it dries out fast.
Check this dish in the oven every few minutes as it gets close
to the end of cooking. If you’re worried about overcooking, pull
it out just before it looks done (when the flesh almost flakes
with a fork) and let it rest on the pan for a minute, as it will
keep cooking once you take it out of the oven. You can also use
a meat thermometer—pull it out of the oven when the center of
the fish is between 130° and 135°F.

## Notes

Halibut is delicious, but it can also
be expensive. You can substitute a
variety of white fish here—try cod,
turbot, dogfish, haddock, or striped
bass. If you don’t want to juice
the orange by hand, substitute
cup store-bought orange juice.
