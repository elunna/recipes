# grilled coconut-curry chicken
---
Yield: 2 servings

## Ingredients
3 tablespoons cooking fat
1/2 onion, finely diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tablespoon yellow curry powder
1 cup canned crushed tomatoes
1/2 cup coconut cream (see page 178)
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1 1/2 pounds bone-in, skin-on, split
chicken breasts (2 pieces)
1 lime, quartered

## Instructions
1. TO make the curry sauce, melt the cooking fat in a sauce-
pan over medium heat and swirl to coat the bottom of the
pan. When the fat is hot, add the onion and cook, stirring,
until translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the garlic and stir
until it becomes aromatic, about 30 seconds. Add the curry
powder and stir for 15 to 20 seconds, taking care that the
garlic and curry powder don’t burn. Add the tomatoes and
simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes. Transfer the con-
tents of the pan to a food processor or blender and puree
until smooth. Pour into a mixing bowl and let cool. Mix in
the coconut cream, salt, and pepper.


2. PLACE the chicken in a shallow bowl. Pour some of the
sauce over the chicken and brush it on each side.
3. PREHEAT a grill to high heat (500°F).
4. REMOVE the chicken from the curry sauce and discard the
extra sauce. Add the chicken, breast-side down, to the grill
and sear until golden brown, about 2 minutes. (When the
meat is properly seared it will pull off the grates very easily,
so don’t rush this step.) Turn the chicken over so the bone
side is down and place over indirect heat. Cover with the
grill lid and continue to cook until the internal temperature
of the chicken is 160°F, or the breast meat springs back
when pressed with a finger. This will take 10 to 15 minutes,
depending on thickness.
5. LET the chicken rest for 5 minutes. Serve with a squeeze of
lime juice and the reserved curry sauce.



### MAKE IT A MEAL:
This recipe goes great with
Cauliflower Rice (page 272) and Sautéed Kale with
Almonds (page 298), or grilled peppers, onions, and
pineapple (see page 164).

## Notes

Don’t pour all the curry sauce over the
chicken; once the mixture has come into
contact with the raw meat, you have to
throw it out. Instead, place your chicken
in a shallow bowl, and pour a little of
the sauce over the chicken. Brush or rub
it evenly over the meat, then flip and
repeat on the other side. Save the extra
sauce to drizzle over the top of this dish
before serving, or use it to top tomorrow
night’s chicken, shrimp, or vegetables.

### BAKED COCONUT-CURRY CHICKEN
If you don't have a grill, you can bake the chicken in the oven. Set to Broil (or 500F)  and place the raw chicken in a baking dish. Sear the chicken in the oven or 5 min. Reduce the oven temp to 350F. Brush the chicken with the curry sauce and finish cooking in the oven for 10-15 min.
