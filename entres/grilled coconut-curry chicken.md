# grilled coconut-curry chicken
---
Yield: 2 servings

## Ingredients
- 3 tbsp cooking fat
- 1/2 onion, finely diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp yellow curry powder
- 1 cup canned crushed tomatoes
- 1/2 cup coconut cream
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1 1/2 lb bone-in, skin-on, split
- chicken breasts (2 pieces)
- 1 lime, quartered

## Instructions
### To make the curry sauce
1. Melt the cooking fat in a sauce-pan over medium heat and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan.
2. When the fat is hot, add the onion and cook, stirring, until translucent, 2 to 3 minutes.
3. Add the garlic and stir until it becomes aromatic, about 30 seconds.
4. Add the curry powder and stir for 15 to 20 seconds, taking care that the garlic and curry powder don’t burn.
5. Add the tomatoes and simmer until thickened, about 5 minutes.
6. Transfer the contents of the pan to a food processor or blender and puree until smooth.
7. Pour into a mixing bowl and let cool. Mix in the coconut cream, salt, and pepper.

### Chicken
1. Place the chicken in a shallow bowl. Pour some of the sauce over the chicken and brush it on each side.
2. Preheat a grill to high heat (500°F).
3. Remove the chicken from the curry sauce and discard the extra sauce. Add the chicken, breast-side down, to the grill and sear until golden brown, about 2 minutes. (When the meat is properly seared it will pull off the grates very easily, so don’t rush this step.) Turn the chicken over so the bone side is down and place over indirect heat.
4. Cover with the grill lid and continue to cook until the internal temperature of the chicken is 160°F, or the breast meat springs back when pressed with a finger. This will take 10 to 15 minutes, depending on thickness.
5. Let the chicken rest for 5 minutes. Serve with a squeeze of lime juice and the reserved curry sauce.

### MAKE IT A MEAL:
This recipe goes great with Cauliflower Rice and Sautéed Kale with Almonds, or grilled peppers, onions, and pineapple.

## Notes
Don’t pour all the curry sauce over the chicken; once the mixture has come into contact with the raw meat, you have to throw it out. Instead, place your chicken in a shallow bowl, and pour a little of the sauce over the chicken. Brush or rub it evenly over the meat, then flip and repeat on the other side. Save the extra sauce to drizzle over the top of this dish before serving, or use it to top tomorrow night’s chicken, shrimp, or vegetables.

### BAKED COCONUT-CURRY CHICKEN
If you don't have a grill, you can bake the chicken in the oven. Set to Broil (or 500F)  and place the raw chicken in a baking dish. Sear the chicken in the oven for 5 min. Reduce the oven temp to 350F. Brush the chicken with the curry sauce and finish cooking in the oven for 10-15 min.
