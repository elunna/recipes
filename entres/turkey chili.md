3. Return the browned turkey to the pot and add the remaining ingredients. Stir until combined and bring to a boil.

4. Once the chili is boiling, lower the heat to a simmer and cook, uncovered, for 45 to 60 minutes or until it thickens. Taste and adjust seasonings, as needed.

5. Serve immediately, garnished with your desired toppings!
