---
Yield: 4 servings
Prep time: 45 min

## Ingredients
4 port couscous
1 clove
3 dl sour cream
salt
pepper
1 dl green olives with pimiento
1/2 pack plum tomatoes (500g, or 3-4 tomatoes)
4 chicken fillets
1/2 tbsp oil
2 tbsp frozen basil
1/2 tbsp liquid honey

## Instructions

1. Cook the couscous
2. Squeeze the garlic into the cream file and taste with salt and pepper.
3. Let the olives drain in a strainer. Cut the tomatoes into pieces.
4. Fry the chicken in the oil in a frying pan for about 4 minutes per side or until done. Season with salt and pepper.
5. Chop the basil. Lower the heat on the frying pan and stir the honey and sprinkle the basil over the chicken. Turn a few times so that the honey and the basil will end up around the whole chicken.
6. Serve the chicken with couscous, sour cream, tomatoes and olives.

## Notes

If you think fried chicken can sometimes feel boring then here we have a great tip to turn it around. You fry it with basil and some honey! Fits perfectly with couscous and accessories such as sour cream, olives and tomatoes.

Marinate the chicken beforehand for more flavor.
