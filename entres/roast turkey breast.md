# Roast Turkey Breast
---
Yield: 8 servings
Prep time: 10 min

## Ingredients
2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
1 1/2 tsp coarse salt
1 tsp freshly ground white pepper
1 bone-in, skin-on turkey breast half (about 2 1/2 lb)

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 400F. Stir together oil, salt, and white pepper; brush over turkey.

2. Roast turkey on a rimmed baking sheet until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reaches 140 degrees and climbing, ~60 minutes. Let rest for at least 15 minutes. Slice turkey as needed. (Reserve pan drippings if making Turkey-Corn Salad.)

Turkey can be refrigerated for up to 5 days.


## Notes

No matter how you slice it, this turkey can be used in a variety of ways. Serve it for Thanksgiving, sliced over salad, or thinly sliced and pressed between hearty Italian bread for a delicious sandwich.

Tips: Add garlic, onion, rosemary, bay leaves, oregano, and cayenne.
