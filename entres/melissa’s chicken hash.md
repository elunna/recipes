# melissa’s chicken hash
---
Yield: 2 servings

## Ingredients
- 2 tbsp cooking fat
- 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch dice
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1/4 cup chopped walnuts
- 1 sweet potato, peeled and grated
- 1 Granny Smith apple, cored, peeled, and diced
- 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes
- 1/4 cup apple cider
- 2 generous handfuls arugula or baby spinach
- Splash of apple cider vinegar

## Instructions
1. IN a large skillet, heat the cooking fat over medium-high
heat, swirling to coat the bottom of the pan. When the fat
is hot, add the chicken, being sure not to crowd the pieces.
Season the chicken with the salt and pepper. Cook until
browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the chicken to brown the
other sides, add the walnuts, and cook until the chicken
is browned and the walnuts are toasted, 2 to 3 minutes.
(Shake the pan occasionally so the walnuts don’t burn.)
Add the sweet potato, apple, and red pepper flakes and
cook, stirring often, until the chicken is fully cooked, 3 to 4
minutes.
2. ADD the apple cider and mix all the ingredients together,
scraping the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to
bring up any tasty bits. Add the arugula and cook for
another 30 seconds, gently stirring to the wilt leaves.
Drizzle with the splash of apple cider vinegar and serve
immediately.

### LEFTOVERS
You can also spiral slice your sweet potato
instead of grating it to save some time. Use your spiral slicer
to create thin noodles, then chop them into l-inch pieces and
cook as directed. This dish is just as delicious eaten cold,
like a fancy chicken salad. Spoon leftovers on a bed of fresh
greens, drizzle with a little olive oil and apple cider vinegar,
and garnish with some diced avocado.


## Notes
Melissa Hartwig created this recipe out
of egg-boredom one morning, and found
that chicken and apple is a surprisingly
delicious combination. One night over
dinner, she shared her favorite egg-free
breakfast idea with Chef Richard, who
envisioned adding texture and punch
in the form of walnuts and apple cider
vinegar. Now, it’s one of Pre-Made
Paleo’s best-selling meals (see page
403 for details), and remains one of
Melissa’s favorite no-egg breakfasts.
