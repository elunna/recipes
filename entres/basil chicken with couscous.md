---
Yield: 4 servings
Prep time: 45 min

## Ingredients
- 4 port couscous
- 1 tbsp garlic, minced
- 3 dl sour cream
- salt
- pepper
- 1 dl green olives with pimiento, drained
- 1/2 pack plum tomatoes (500g, or 3-4 tomatoes), cut into pieces
- 4 chicken fillets
- 1/2 tbsp oil
- 2 tbsp basil, roughly chopped
- 1/2 tbsp liquid honey

## Instructions
1. Cook the couscous
2. Mix the garlic into the sour cream and taste with salt and pepper.
3. Fry the chicken in the oil in a frying pan for about 4 minutes per side or until done.
4. Season with salt and pepper.
5. Lower the heat on the frying pan and stir the honey and sprinkle the basil over the chicken. Turn a few times so that the honey and the basil will end up around the whole chicken.
6. Serve the chicken with couscous, sour cream, tomatoes and olives.

## Notes
If you think fried chicken can sometimes feel boring then here we have a great tip to turn it around. You fry it with basil and some honey! Fits perfectly with couscous and accessories such as sour cream, olives and tomatoes.

Marinate the chicken beforehand for more flavor.
