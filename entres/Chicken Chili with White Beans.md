# Chicken Chili with White Beans
---
This chicken chili is a hearty, healthy dish you can feel good about eating. 
Yield: 6-8

## Ingredients
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
2 cups chopped yellow onions, from 2 medium onions
1 red bell pepper, diced
6 medium garlic cloves, minced
2 pounds ground chicken (preferably not labeled "lean")
3 tablespoons chili powder
1 tablespoon ground cumin
2 teaspoons ground coriander
¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes (omit for milder chili)
1 teaspoon dried oregano
⅛ teaspoon cayenne pepper
2 teaspoons salt
2 (26 oz.) cartons Pomi chopped tomatoes or two (28 oz.) cans chopped or diced tomatoes
2 cups low sodium chicken broth
1 teaspoon sugar
1 (15 oz.) can Cannellini beans, drained and rinsed

## Instructions
1. Heat the oil in a large nonreactive pot over medium heat. Add the onions and red bell pepper and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring to prevent garlic from burning, about two minutes more.
2. Increase the heat to medium-high. Add the ground chicken, chili powder, cumin, coriander, red pepper flakes, oregano, cayenne pepper, and salt. As the chicken cooks, use a wooden spoon to break the meat into very small clumps; cook until no longer pink, about 5 minutes.
3. Add the tomatoes, chicken broth, and sugar. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer, partially covered with lid ajar, for about one hour, stirring occasionally.
4. Stir in the white beans and simmer, uncovered for about 50 minutes more, or until the meat is tender and the flavors are well combined. For a soupier chili, you can add additional water. For a thicker chili, simmer uncovered until desired consistency is reached. Taste and add more salt if necessary.

## Notes

Note: Pomi boxed tomatoes are available at some regular grocers, Whole Foods and gourmet food shops.

Note: A nonreactive pot is made of a material that will not react negatively with acidic ingredients. Stainless steel, enamel, glass and nonstick (as long as there are no scratches in the nonstick coating) are all safe to use. Do not use cast iron or aluminum.

Freezer-Friendly Instructions: The chili can be frozen for up to 3 months. Reheat it on the stovetop over medium-low heat until hot. (The chili will thicken up some when frozen, so you’ll likely need to add some broth when reheating.)
