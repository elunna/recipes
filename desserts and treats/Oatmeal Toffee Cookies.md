# Oatmeal Toffee Cookies
---
Yield: 2 dozen 3-inch cookies
Prep time:

## Ingredients
1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature
¾ cup granulated sugar
¾ cup light-brown sugar
1 egg
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
1 ½ cups oatmeal
1 cup dried cherries
1 cup bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped
1 cup toffee pieces, (5 ½ ounces)

## Instructions
1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Sift together flour and baking soda, and set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream butter and sugars on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl once or twice during mixing. Add egg, and mix on high speed to combine. Add vanilla extract; mix to combine. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.
2. Add the sifted flour a bit at a time on a low speed until well combined. Add oatmeal, cherries, chocolate, and toffee pieces; mix to combine.
3. Divide dough into three equal portions, and roll into logs using plastic wrap, approximately 1 1/2 inches in diameter. To bake, cut logs into 3/4-inch pieces. Bake on parchment-lined baking sheets, until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven, and transfer to a baking rack to cool.

## Notes

This oatmeal-cookie dough can be baked immediately, refrigerated for one to two days, or frozen for up to a month.

Tips: coarsely chop oatmeal and semi-sweet chocolate chip, in addition to the cranberries. It better distributes the flavors. I also roll them into 1" logs (not 1.5"), for smaller cookies, makes more cookies that way.
