# NEVER-ENDING VANILLA EXTRACT
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
3 vanilla pods
1/2 cup vodka (or bourbon, brandy or rum)

Split the vanilla pods lengthwise. Place in your bottle or jar (cut them in half to fit if need be) and cover with vodka/booze. Seal, shake, and store in the dark. Whenever you see it in your pantry, give it a shake (a few times a week); it will be ready to use in 4 weeks.

Make it bottomless: Simply add more booze as you drain the bottle. Also add another pod or two as the flavor wanes (a great way to use up pods)
