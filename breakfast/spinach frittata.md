# Spinach Frittata
---
Yield: 2 servings

## Ingredients
6 large eggs, beaten
a teaspoon salt
4 teaspoon black pepper
2 tablespoons cooking fat
4 onion, diced
1 cup diced seeded tomato (plus a few
slices for topping the frittata)
1 bag (about 9 ounces) baby spinach,
roughly chopped
Grated zest and juice of 4 lemon

## Instructions
1. SET the oven to broil (or preheat to 500°F).
2. IN a mixing bowl, whisk the eggs with the salt and pepper.
3. HEAT a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat.
4. Add the cooking fat to the pan and swirl to coat the bottom.
5. When the fat is hot, add the onion and tomato and cook, stirring, until softened, 2-3 minutes.
6. Add the spinach and let it wilt for 30 seconds.
7. Add the eggs and fold them into the vegetables with a rubber spatula.
8. Cook, without stirring to let the eggs set on the bottom and sides of the pan, until the eggs are frm and still appear wet, 3-4 minutes.
9. Lay a few tomato slices on top. Drizzle the lemon juice and sprinkle the lemon zest over the top.
10. TRANSFER the pan with the eggs to the oven and broil 4-6 inches from the heat (or bake in the preheated oven) for 3-5 minutes, until the top is golden brown.
11. Cut into slices and serve hot out of the pan.

### COOKING VARIATIONS

If you don’t have an oven-safe skillet, you can cook the frittata in a regular pan on the stovetop, then transfer the frittata to a Pyrex dish to broil.
Preheat the oven to 350°F, and grease the bottom and sides of your baking dish with coconut oil or ghee. Cook the vegetables in a large frying pan on the stovetop as directed. Then, add the cooked vegetables to the bowl with the eggs, and transfer the mixture to the baking dish. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until the frittata is set in the center and slightly golden on top. Drizzle the lemon juice and sprinkle the zest over the top just before serving. Your frittata will reheat beautifully the next day. Or enjoy it cold! A slice is a really easy and delicious on-the-go breakfast or lunch.

## Notes

- Mix and match vegetables and meat to vary the flavors of your frittatas.
- Try making it Mexican (spiced cooked ground beef, thinly sliced jalapefios, diced tomato, and cilantro),
- Italian (cooked sausage, red peppers, onions, and basil),
- Greek (cooked chicken, sun-dried tomatoes, black olives, and artichoke hearts),
- or use any leftover meat and vegetables you happen to have in your fridge for a kitchen sink frittata.
