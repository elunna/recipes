# seared salmon benedict
---
Yield: 2 servings

## Ingredients
- 2 salmon fillets (5 oz each), skin removed
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 3 tbsp cooking fat
- 2 large eggs, poached
- 2 cup Whole30 Hollandaise
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
2. Season both sides of salmon evenly with the salt and pepper.
3. In a large oven-safe skillet, heat the cooking fat over medium-high heat, swirling to coat the bottom of the pan.
4. When the fat is hot, add the salmon fillets skinned-side down. Sear the salmon until you see the edges start to pull away from the pan, 3-4 minutes.
5. Slide a metal spatula under each fillet and turn. (If they are ready, they will come off with little effort, so don’t rush this step! If the fillets
don’t readily release, allow another minute before turning them over.)
6. Transfer the pan to the oven and bake for 5-7 minutes, until white “curd” protein starts to show on the sides of the salmon. Check often, as thinner salmon will cook faster.
7. Transfer the cooked salmon to a plate.
8. Place the poached eggs over the salmon fillets and drizzle evenly with the hollandaise.
9. Top with a dash or two of cayenne pepper and black pepper.

### SKINNING SALMON
To remove the skin from salmon, place the fillet skin-side down on a flat surface. Pressing gently on the top of the fillet to hold it in place, slide a sharp knife between the skin and the flesh closest to your body. While holding on to the flap of skin you just created, slide the knife away from you, separating the skin from the flesh. Discard the skin. Most fish markets and health food stores will skin your fish for you, so feel free to ask your fishmonger for this service before he wraps up your purchase.

## Notes
It’s important that the fat be very hot to properly sear fish. To test, toss in a few grains of sea salt, or a small piece of your ingredients (like a bit of garlic or a small square of onion). If it sizzles, your pan is ready! You can also stick the end of a chopstick or a wooden spoon into the oil. If bubbles form around the wood, you’ve reached the right temperature.
