# diner breakfast: eggs, sausage, and home fries
---
Yield: 2 servings

## Ingredients
- 3 tbsp cooking fat
- 1/4 cup finely diced white onion
- 1/2 lb ground meat (pork, chicken, turkey)
- 1/4 tsp dried sage
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/8 tsp black pepper
- 1/8 tsp garlic powder
- 1 sweet potato, peeled and cut into large dice
- 1/2 bell pepper, (any color), seeded, ribs removed, and diced
- 4 large eggs, cracked into a bowl

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.
2. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
3. To make the sausage, heat 1 tbsp of the cooking fat in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat.
4. When the fat is hot, add the onion and cook, stirring, for until softened, about 2 minutes.
5. Transfer the onion to a mixing bowl and add the ground meat, sage, salt, pepper, and garlic powder.
6. Form the mixture into 4 equal patties and set the sausage aside.
7. To make the home fries, return the same skillet to the stove and heat over medium-high heat. Melt 1 tbsp
of the cooking fat and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan.
8. When the fat is hot, add the sweet potato and cook, stirring occasionally so all sides make contact with the hot pan, for 4 minutes.
9. Add the bell pepper and cook, stirring, until softened, 2 to 3 minutes.
10. Spread the home fries mixture evenly onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 5 minutes.
11. Meanwhile, to cook the sausage, return the same skillet to the stove and heat over medium heat.
12. Add the sausage patties and cook until browned, about 2 minutes on each side.
13. Add the sausage to the home fries on the baking sheet.
14. Return to the oven and bake for 5 to 7 minutes, until the sausage is no longer pink in the middle and the home fries
are fork-tender.
15. Meanwhile, to cook the eggs, add the remaining 1 tbsp cooking fat to the same skillet and melt over medium heat.
16. Slide all 4 eggs gently into the pan and let them cook slowly, yolk-side up, until the yolks are cooked but still
bright in color, 5 to 8 minutes.
17. Arrange the sausage patties and home fries on 2 plates. With a spatula, carefully remove the eggs from the pan and either lay them over the home fries or place on the side.

## Notes

This all-in-one breakfast would be delicious with some Hollandaise, Ranch Dressing, Chimichurri, or Buffalo Sauce drizzled over the top.
