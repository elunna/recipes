# southwest scrambled eggs
---
Yield: 2 servings

## Ingredients
- 1 avocado, split lengthwise, pitted, and peeled
- 2 tbsp cooking fat
- 6 large eggs, beaten
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 tsp black pepper
- 1 cup salsa

## Instructions
1. SET the avocado halves flat side down on a cutting board
and cut into thin slices.
2. HEAT the cooking fat in a large skillet over medium heat.
3. In a mixing bowl, whisk the eggs with the salt and pepper.
4. When the oil is hot, add the eggs and cook, stirring and scraping the bottom and sides of the pan to prevent burning, until the eggs are scrambled, fluffy, and still look wet but not runny, 5-7 minutes.
5. DIVIDE the eggs between 2 plates, top with the avocado, and spoon the salsa evenly over both portions.

Make it a meal: Serve with steamed spinach and pan-fried plantains; or last nightâ€™s leftover veggies and a side of berries.
