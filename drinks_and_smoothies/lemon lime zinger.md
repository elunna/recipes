### A ZINGER
can be made with a variety of
juices. Try this mix: 1/2 lemon juiced, 1/2 lime
juiced, 1 orange juiced, and 2 tbsp of
pomegranate juice, top with ice and sparkling
water. Using juice from a bottle? Try 1/4 cup of
pineapple juice and 1 tsp of fresh ginger,
zested, top with ice and sparkling water. Looking
for something less sweet? How about 1/4 cup of
unsweetened cranberry juice plus 1/2 lemon juiced,
top with ice and sparkling water.
