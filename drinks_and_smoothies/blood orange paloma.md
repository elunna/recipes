12 oz sparkling water

grapefruit or lime wedge. To add another dimension
to this mocktail, try adding fresh squeezed grapefruit
juice; it pairs nicely with the blood orange and lime.



STORE YOUR BLOOD ORANGES in the fridge—
they'll last up to two weeks, compared to just a few
days on the counter. Blood oranges are in season
from December through May, so if you’re serving
this in the summertime, feel free to substitute any
other variety of orange. (And if you’re using orange
juice from a carton, use 1/3 cup.)
