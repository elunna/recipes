Yield: 

## Ingredients
- 1 blood orange, juiced
- 1/2 lime, juiced
- 12 oz sparkling water

## Instructions
1. Add the blood orange and lime into a glass.
2. Top with ice and the sparkling water.

## Notes
Serving this at a fancy gathering? Garnish with a grapefruit or lime wedge. To add another dimension to this mocktail, try adding fresh squeezed grapefruit juice; it pairs nicely with the blood orange and lime.

Store your blood oranges in the fridge — they'll last up to 2 weeks, compared to just a few days on the counter. Blood oranges are in season from December through May, so if you’re serving this in the summertime, feel free to substitute any other variety of orange. (And if you’re using orange juice from a carton, use 1/3 cup.)
