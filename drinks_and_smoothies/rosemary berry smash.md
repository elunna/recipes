# rosemary berry smash
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
1/4 cup raspberries (fresh or frozen)
1 sprig fresh rosemary leaves
1/2 lemon, juiced
12 oz sparkling water

## Instructions
1. MUDDLE raspberries and rosemary leaves in a
large glass. 
2. Add the lemon juice and sparkling
water, and shake or mix thoroughly. 
3. Strain the
mixture into a new glass, discarding the rose-
mary leaves. 
4. Add ice if desired.




TO REMOVE the rosemary leaves from the
stem, hold the top of the stem between your thumb
and index finger. Use the same fingers on your
other hand to strip the needles from the stem ina
downward motion.


## Notes

To muddle means to press the ingredients against
the side or bottom of the glass. Muddling helps
to release the flavors of the fresh ingredients.
You can buy an actual muddler for around
$10, or you can use the heavy end of a butter
knife or the round end of a wooden spoon.
