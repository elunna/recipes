# Red currant juice
---
Yield:
Prep time: 60+ min

## Ingredients
1 kg red currants
4 dl water
3 dl str√∂socker/powdered sugar (per L of rounded juice)
1 krm natriumbensoat/sodium benzoate (per L of finished juice)

## Instructions

1. Rinse the berries, you do not need to remove the stalks. Boil the water in a large saucepan. Put down the currants and cook under the lid for 10 minutes.

2. Pour the cook through a screen cloth on a strainer rack or kitchen towel into a strainer. Leave for about 30 minutes until it stops dripping. Do not press the carrier mass, then the juice will be cloudy.

3. Measure the juice and calculate the amount of sugar. Pour the juice back into a clean saucepan and add the sugar. Boil and allow the juice to boil on low heat for about 5 minutes. Foam off. Measure the juice and calculate the amount of sodium benzoate. Stir in sodium benzoate in 1 dl of the juice and then mix with the rest.

4. Pour the juice onto warm, sterilized bottles and place on the cork (see link above). Store in a dark and cool place.

## Notes

Do you have red currants in the garden? Juice the sour currants. The refreshing juice is childishly good and cools wonderfully in the summer heat. Serve in a large glass with plenty of ice.

For 8 dl of rounded juice, about 4, 75 dl of sugar and about 0.5 krm of sodium benzoate are needed.
