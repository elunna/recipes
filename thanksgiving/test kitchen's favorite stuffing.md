# Test Kitchen's Favorite Stuffing
---
Yield: 8-12 servings
Prep time: 20 min

## Ingredients
- 1 loaf sliced country white bread (about 16 slices), cut into 1-inch pieces (14 cup)
- 6 tbsp unsalted butter, plus more, softened, for brushing
- 2 medium onions, chopped (3 cup)
- 3 celery stalks, sliced crosswise into 1/4-inch pieces (1 1/2 cup)
- Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
- 2 cloves garlic, minced (1 tbsp)
- 12 fresh sage leaves, finely chopped (2 tbsp)
- 1/3 cup dry white wine, such as Sauvignon Blanc
- 3/4 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, plus more for serving
- 1 1/2 cup Simple Giblet Stock, or store-bought no-sodium-added chicken stock
- 3 large eggs, lightly beaten

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 300 degrees.
2. Divide bread between 2 rimmed baking sheets and spread in a single layer.
3. Bake, stirring a few times, until crisp and dry, about 40 minutes. Let cool.
4. Break a piece open to make sure it's dried all the way through; if not, bake a few more minutes. Transfer to a large bowl.
5. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium-high.
6. Add onions, celery, and 2 tsp salt.
7. Cook, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are soft and golden in places, 7 to 9 minutes.
8. Add garlic, sage, and 1/4 tsp pepper; cook 1 minute.
9. Pour in wine; cook until mostly evaporated, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat.
10. Increase oven temperature to 375 degrees.
11. Brush a 2 1/2-qt baking dish with butter.
12. Transfer onion mixture to bowl with toasted bread;
13. Add parsley.
14. Drizzle with stock, stirring to combine.
15. Stir in eggs to evenly coat.
16. Transfer to prepared baking dish.
17. Top with buttered parchment; loosely wrap with foil. (If making ahead, refrigerate at this point until you're ready to bake.)
18. Bake 20 minutes.
19. Uncover; continue cooking until golden on top, about 20 minutes more.
20. Serve, with more parsley sprinkled on top.

### Cook's Notes
### Stuffing vs. Dressing
These terms are often used interchangeably, but there is one big difference. Unlike stuffing, which is "stuffed" inside the turkey before roasting, dressing is baked separately. The dressing here can be cooked inside the bird; just be sure a thermometer inserted into the center of the stuffing reaches 165 degrees.

## Notes
We like to use soft country white bread (which is sliced thicker than regular sandwich bread) in this classic stuffing/dressing because it absorbs flavors best. You can also try a fancier rustic loaf, such as pane Pugliese.
