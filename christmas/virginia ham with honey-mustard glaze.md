# Virginia Ham with Honey-Mustard Glaze
---
Yield: 18 to 24 Serves

## Ingredients
1 whole bone-in Virginia honey ham (about 18 lb), such as Edwards
1/2 cup honey
1/3 cup Dijon mustard, plus more for serving
1/3 cup packed light-brown sugar
1/4 tsp ground cloves

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees with a rack in lower third. Line a roasting pan with a rack. Wrap ham in parchment-lined foil. Transfer to pan, with thicker rind side facing up. Bake 2 1/2 hours. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, stir together honey, Dijon, brown sugar, and cloves.
2. Unwrap ham. When cool enough to handle, use a thin-bladed knife to peel rind from ham and trim fat all over to 1/2 inch. Score skin and fat with tip of knife in opposite directions, to create a 3/4-inch-wide diamond pattern.
3. Return ham to oven and bake, uncovered, 30 minutes. Baste with some of honey-mustard mixture and continue to bake, basting every 30 minutes, until a thermometer inserted into thickest part of flesh near (but not touching) bone registers 145 degrees, about 2 hours more. (If necessary, add water to pan, 1/4 cup at a time, to prevent scorching, and tent with foilif ham begins to blacken.)
4. Let ham stand at least 20 minutes before carving, or let cool completely and serve at room temperature. Thinly slice against the bone; serve.

## Notes

A baked ham is an ideal centerpiece for a holiday table: It's equally delicious served warm or at room temperature, and the leftovers are excellent in everything from soups to sandwiches to frittatas.
