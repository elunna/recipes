# roasted root vegetables in curry sauce
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
- 1 cup peeled diced potato (any variety)
- 1 cup peeled diced rutabaga
- 1 cup peeled diced turnips
- 1 cup peeled diced parsnips
- 1 cup peeled diced carrots
- 1/4 cup cooking fat
- 1/2 cup Curry Sauce (page 307)

## Instructions
1. PREHEAT the oven to 400°F. Line 2 baking sheets with
parchment paper.
2. MELT the cooking fat (if necessary), combine with all
the vegetables in a large mixing bowl, and toss or mix to
thoroughly coat. Spread the vegetables in one layer on the
2 baking sheets. Do not crowd the vegetables or they'll
steam instead of roast.
3. ROAST for 30 to 40 minutes, until the vegetables are
lightly browned on the outside and fork-tender. Transfer to
a serving bowl or individual plates and top with the Curry
sauce.


### MAKE IT A MEAL:
You could add cooked sausage,
chicken sausage, chicken, or sliced beef to the vegetable
mixture just before serving to make this a meal—just heat
your protein in a pan or microwave before mixing with
the hot vegetables. You can also pair this dish with Perfect
Fried Eggs (page 149), Perfect Seared Chicken Breast (page
157), or Chicken Meatballs (page 226).

### PEELING RUTABAGA
Rutabaga is a direct cross between
a cabbage and a turnip, and when cooked, tastes both sweet
and savory. It can be tough to peel, though—your standard
kitchen peeler (especially if it’s dull) may not work. If your
standard peeler isn’t getting the job done, use a paring knife.
First, cut the rutabaga in half. Place each half flat-side down
ona cutting board and, using a sharp paring knife, carefully
slice the skin off in 2-inch increments. (You may need a few
passes to get to the lighter colored flesh underneath.) Repeat
on the other half.


## Notes


Mix and match some of the heartier
vegetables based on what's in season,
available at your local grocery store,
or what you feel like eating. They
don’t have to be roots, either! Beets,
celery root, kohlrabi, eggplant,
Brussels sprouts, broccoli, cauliflower,
salsify, or cassava (yuca) would all
work well with the curry sauce.
