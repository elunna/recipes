# roasted root vegetables in curry sauce
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
- 1 cup peeled diced potato (any variety)
- 1 cup peeled diced rutabaga
- 1 cup peeled diced turnips
- 1 cup peeled diced parsnips
- 1 cup peeled diced carrots
- 1/4 cup cooking fat
- 1/2 cup Curry Sauce

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 400°F.
2. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
3. Melt the cooking fat (if necessary), combine with all the vegetables in a large mixing bowl, and toss or mix to thoroughly coat.
4. Spread the vegetables in one layer on the 2 baking sheets. Do not crowd the vegetables or they'll steam instead of roast.
5. Roast for 30 to 40 minutes, until the vegetables are lightly browned on the outside and fork-tender.
6. Transfer to a serving bowl or individual plates and top with the Curry sauce.

### MAKE IT A MEAL:
You could add cooked sausage, chicken sausage, chicken, or sliced beef to the vegetable mixture just before serving to make this a meal—just heat your protein in a pan or microwave before mixing with the hot vegetables. You can also pair this dish with Perfect Fried Eggs, Perfect Seared Chicken Breast, or Chicken Meatballs.

### PEELING RUTABAGA
Rutabaga is a direct cross between a cabbage and a turnip, and when cooked, tastes both sweet and savory. It can be tough to peel, though—your standard kitchen peeler (especially if it’s dull) may not work. If your standard peeler isn’t getting the job done, use a paring knife.  First, cut the rutabaga in half. Place each half flat-side down ona cutting board and, using a sharp paring knife, carefully slice the skin off in 2-inch increments. (You may need a few passes to get to the lighter colored flesh underneath.) Repeat
on the other half.

## Notes
Mix and match some of the heartier vegetables based on what's in season, available at your local grocery store, or what you feel like eating. They don’t have to be roots, either! Beets, celery root, kohlrabi, eggplant, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, cauliflower, salsify, or cassava (yuca) would all work well with the curry sauce.
