# Brussels Sprouts with Oranges and Bacon
---
Yield: 6 servings
Prep time: 15 min

## Ingredients
1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing
2 small oranges, cut in half, then into 1/2-inch slices
Kosher salt
3 to 4 strips thick-cut bacon, cut into 1/4-inch pieces (1 cup)
1 1/2 lb brussels sprouts, trimmed and halved

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Brush a rimmed baking sheet generously with oil. Add oranges, in a single layer, turning to coat. Season with salt and drizzle with 1 tbsp oil; roast 15 minutes. Add bacon and roast until crisp, about 12 minutes.

2. Toss brussels sprouts with remaining 4 tbsp oil; season with salt. Add to baking sheet; toss to combine. Roast, tossing once, until sprouts are tender and browning at edges and oranges are deeply caramelized, 25 to 30 minutes more.

Cook's Notes: 
If you take the time to separate a few of the sprouts into leaves, you will be rewarded with crunchy, almost burnt bits along with the softer caramelized sprouts. You may find you want to make a whole tray of them. See ya later, kale chips!

## Notes

Small thin-skinned oranges work best here. Look for organic, as you are going to want to eat the whole fruit. The combination of sweet orange, lightly smoky bacon, and caramelized brussels sprouts is absolutely addictive.
