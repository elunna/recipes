# Cooked beans and legumes
---
Yield: 3 cups

I'm not a paid-up fan of legumes
(oh, the bloat), but when prepared
and cooked properly they’re a
reasonably nutritious addition to
the diet and an economical way
to pad out a dish. Most books
at this point feature a highly
complex chart of different soaking
and cooking times for the myriad
beans and legumes out there.
A waste of paper and your sweet
time! | assure you it can be as
flow-y as this:


## Ingredients
- I soak my lentils for 7 hours, even through most people don't.

1 cup dried beans (any type, even lentils or mung beans)
3 cups hot water
3 teaspoons whey, apple cider vinegar or lemon juice (Optional, but it will break down the phytic acid even more.)


## Instructions

Place all of the ingredients in a bowl
and leave to soak overnight. The
next morning, drain and transfer to
a saucepan. Cover with water and
bring to the boil over medium heat.
Boil for 10 minutes, then reduce the
heat and simmer until the beans are
soft (up to 1 hour).

Cool and divide into 1-cup portions
(2 cup of beans and 1/2 cup of their
cooking liquid). Beans and stock
will keep in the fridge for 3-4 days
like this. Or you can freeze for up to
6 months.

## Notes



A few things about beans and legumes:


- Avoid canned (unless you
can find organic)—they’re
not prepared properly.
Plus there’s the carbon
footprint (and BPA issues)
from the can.
- Brown lentils are your
most nutritious option.
And are also the quickest
to cook. They’re featured
a bit in this book.
- Soak most of them for
24 hours if you can. This
will eliminate 20-50%
of the phytic acid.
- Store your beans in their
cooking stock. They keep
better (in both fridge and
freezer) and can be used
together for most dishes.
