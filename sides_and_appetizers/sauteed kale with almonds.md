---
Yield: 2 servings
Prep time: 15 min

## Ingredients
- 1 head kale, stemmed, leaves cut into 1-inch ribbons
- 3 tbsp cooking fat
- 1 tbsp garlic, minced
- 1/4 cup raw sliced almonds
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- grated zest and juice of 1/2 lemon

## Instructions
1. Bring 1 cup of water to boil in a large pot.
2. Place a colander or steamer inside the pot.
3. Add the kale, cover, and steam until the kale is tender but not soft, 3-5 min.
4. Remove the colander or steamer from the pot and transfer to a dish towel to catch any dripping water.
5. Heat the cooking fat in a large skillet over medium-high heat, swirling to coat the bottom of the pan.
6. When the fat is hot, add the garlic and almonds and cook until the garlic is aromatic, ~1 min.
7. Increase the heat to high, add the kale, and cook for 1 min, tossing to combine the kale with the garlic and almonds.
8. Transfer to a serving dish and season with the salt, pepper, and lemon juice.
9. Top with the lemon zest and serve.

## Notes
Make sure to really wash and rinse the kale before cooking.

Match with a Spinach Fritata, Stuffed Peppers, or Baby Back Ribs.

Make kale chips in the oven while this dish is cooking.
- Preheat the oven to 300F.
- Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
- Stem a head of kale and tear the leaves into large pieces.
- Add to a bowl with 1/2 tbsp olive oil and massage well to coat the leaves.
- Lay them out in one layer on the baking sheet and sprinkle with salt.
- Don't crowd the kale or the leaves will steam instead of crisp.
- Bake for 20-25 min or until the edges are brown but not burned.
- Allow to cool on the baking sheet for 5 min and enjoy!
