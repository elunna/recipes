## Notes


Make them even more nutritious:
Sprout your buckwheat first by soaking the raw groats for 1-2 hours, then put them in a fine-meshed sieve over a bowl (or in a big jar with a muslin cloth secured over the top) and wash and drain twice a day for 1-2 days, until tiny little tails form. Then dry in the oven as above.

Make them sweet spice groaties: Combine soaked or sprouted buckwheat with 3 tsp of Pumpkin Spice Mix or 2 tsp of ground cinnamon and 1tsp of ground nutmeg.

Make them salted caramel groaties: Combine soaked or sprouted buckwheat with 2 tsp of maca, 1 tsp of sea salt and 1 tsp of ground cinnamon.


Make them middle eastern groaties: Combine soaked or sprouted buckwheat with 3 tsp of Ras el Hanout Mix and 1 tsp of sea salt.


Buckwheat can get awfully confusing: Buckwheat groats are the raw seeds that look like little light-tan/green pyramids. You cook and eat these like you would quinoa or rice, and you can sprout them for salads. Activated groaties (AKA buckinis) are soaked and then dried at a low temp. They are ready to eat as is, as soup toppers or a crunchy cereal or in desserts. They can also be cooked as you would raw groats, but take less time. Kasha is the name for raw graots that have been toasted.
