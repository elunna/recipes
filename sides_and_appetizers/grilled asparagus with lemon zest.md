### TRIMMING ASPARAGUS
The tougher parts of the asparagus stalk need to be removed before cooking. The easiest way to do this is to simply grasp the lighter colored root end and bend until it snaps. The asparagus will automatically break in just the right spot, so don’t overthink it! You can even grab your asparagus in a small bundle and break the ends off all at once to save some time.

## Notes
To make grilling the asparagus a bit easier, try threading four or five asparagus spears cross-wise on two wooden or metal skewers before seasoning them, or place them in a grill basket or in foil on the grill.  This will keep the asparagus from accidentally falling through the grill grates. If you don’t have a grill, cook the asparagus in a large skillet over medium-high heat in 1 tbsp of cooking fat for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally to cook all sides evenly.
