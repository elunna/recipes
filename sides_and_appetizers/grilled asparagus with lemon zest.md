# grilled asparagus with lemon zest
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
- 1 lb asparagus, trimmed
- 1 tbsp clarified butter, ghee, or coconut oil, melted
- 1/2 tsp salt
- Grated zest and juice of 1 lemon

## Instructions
1. PREHEAT a grill to medium-high heat (400°F). Line a bak-
ing sheet with foil.
2. PLACE the asparagus on the baking sheet, drizzle with
the melted cooking fat, and sprinkle with the salt. With
tongs, transfer the asparagus to the grill, laying the spears
horizontally across the grate, and grill until tender, 4 to 6
minutes.
3. TRANSFER the asparagus to a serving plate. Drizzle the
lemon juice over the top and sprinkle with the lemon zest
just before serving.


### MAKE IT A MEAL
Since you're out there anyway, pair
this with the Perfect Burger (page 153), Perfect Grilled
Shrimp (page 158), or Grilled Coconut-Curry Chicken
(page 230). It’s also a hearty enough side to stand up to
our Baby Back Ribs with Tangy BBQ Sauce (page 256), and
goes great with Seared Salmon Benedict (page 210).


### TRIMMING ASPARAGUS
The tougher parts of the
asparagus stalk need to be removed before cooking. The
easiest way to do this is to simply grasp the lighter colored
root end and bend until it snaps. The asparagus will
automatically break in just the right spot, so don’t overthink
it! You can even grab your asparagus in a small bundle and
break the ends off all at once to save some time.



## Notes

To make grilling the asparagus a
bit easier, try threading four or five
asparagus spears cross-wise on two
wooden or metal skewers before
seasoning them, or place them in
a grill basket or in foil on the grill.
This will keep the asparagus from
accidentally falling through the grill
grates. If you don’t have a grill, cook
the asparagus in a large skillet over
medium-high heat in 1 tbsp of
cooking fat for 10 minutes, stirring
occasionally to cook all sides evenly.
