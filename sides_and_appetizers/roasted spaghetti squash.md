# roasted spaghetti squash
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
- 1 whole spaghetti squash
- 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 tsp fresh thyme leaves (or 1/4 tsp dried)
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper

## Instructions
1. PREHEAT the oven to 425°F. Line a baking sheet with foil
or parchment paper.
2. CUT the squash in half lengthwise and remove the seeds
with a large spoon. Drizzle the insides evenly with the olive
oil. Place the squash flesh-side down on the baking sheet.
3. ROAST the squash for 1 hour, until fork-tender. Carefully
turn the squash flesh-side up and let cool until cool enough
to handle.
4. USE a fork to gently scrape out the flesh; the squash will
come out in noodle-like strands. Season evenly with the
thyme, salt, and pepper, and serve immediately.



### MAKE IT A MEAL: 
It’s supremely easy to turn this veg-
etable side into a complete meal. Top with a meaty Tomato
Sauce (page 324); add cooked sausage, roasted tomatoes,
sautéed onions, and our Pesto (page 315); or mix leftovers
with steamed spinach and top with a few fried eggs for a
quick and easy breakfast.

### CUTTING SQUASH 
Cutting a spaghetti squash in half
might be the most difficult part of this recipe. Melissa
Joulwan, author of the Well Fed cookbook series, suggests
using a paring knife to “score” a groove in the skin first, then
following that groove with a large kitchen knife. You can see a
video of her entire technique at www.w30.co/cutsquash.


## Notes

You can roast the spaghetti squash
whole if you puncture the sides with a
fork first, but your noodles turn out softer
and wetter, as they steam more inside
the full squash. We recommend cutting it
in half and undercooking it slightly so it
has that al-dente pasta texture. You can
check for doneness by poking a sharp
knife through the skin of the upside-
down squash—f it slides through easily,
it’s probably done. You can also use an
oven mitt to flip one half of the squash
over and run a fork down the side of the
squash. If it comes away from the side
in a nice spaghetti texture easily, you’re
good. If your “noodles” are too firm or
don’t easily scrape, flip it back over, put
it back in the oven for 5 to 10 minutes,
and check again. (The ultimate doneness
check? Taste it! Your “spaghetti” should
be tender: not too firm, but not mushy.)
