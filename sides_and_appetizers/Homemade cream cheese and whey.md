## Notes


It's so simple to make your own cream cheese and whey.

32 ounces full-fat organic plain yogurt

Pour the whole tub of yogurt onto a large handkerchief-sized square of
clean cheesecloth or muslin. Bunch the ends together like you’re tying
a sack and secure with an elastic band or string. Suspend the bag over
a large bowl — I attach mine to a wooden spoon placed across the bowl,
while others hang theirs from a cabinet knob, or even a chandelier!
You're going to be straining out the whey, leaving a beautifully creamy
curd in the sack. Drain for 12-24 hours. Store the cream cheese in the
fridge for up to 1 month, and use it as you would the commercial stuff
(see the Cream Cheese Frosting recipe on page 56).

Transfer the whey into an ice-cube tray. When
frozen, store the cubes
in a freezer-proof container in the freezer. Use for fermenting or making
pesto or mayonnaise.



For yogurt: Greek styles are often best, but check the label. It should contain no more than 4.7g of sugar per 1/2-cup serving. This is the natural lactose contained in dairy foods and is fine. Anything over this is added sugar.
