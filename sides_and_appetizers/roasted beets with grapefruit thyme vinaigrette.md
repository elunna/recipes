# roasted beets with grapefruit thyme vinaigrette
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
- 4 medium beets
- 3/4 cup plus 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- 1/4 cup grapefruit juice
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tsp mustard powder
- 2 tsp fresh thyme
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1 package (about 5 oz) arugula
- 1/4 cup slivered or sliced almonds

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 425°F.
2. Rinse the beets thoroughly and carefully stab all sides with a fork. 
3. Place in a medium bowl and add 2 tbsp of the olive oil, tossing or mixing to thoroughly coat.
4. Wrap each of the oiled beets separately in aluminum foil, pinch-ing the tops closed.
5. Place the beets in the center of a baking sheet and roast for 40 minutes.
6. Check the beets by carefully opening the foil and sticking a thin knife into the center of a beet. If it goes in easily, the beets are done. If there’s resistance, close it back up and put the beets back into the oven for 5 minutes. Repeat until they’re done.
7. While the beets are roasting, prepare the vinaigrette. Whisk the grapefruit juice, garlic, and mustard powder together in a small mixing bowl. Add the remaining 3/4 cup of olive oil in a steady stream while whisking to emulsify. Add the thyme and season with the salt and pepper.
8. Let the beets cool until you’re able to handle them. Remove the skin from each beet—you may want to wear gloves, as beet juice will stain skin.
9. Dice the beets into 1-inch pieces and place in a glass storage container with a lid. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to chill before serving.
10. Place the arugula in a serving bowl, add the beets and slivered almonds, and dress with the vinaigrette.
