# roasted beets with grapefruit thyme vinaigrette
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
4 medium beets
3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1/4 cup grapefruit juice
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 teaspoons mustard powder
2 teaspoons fresh thyme
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1 package (about 5 ounces) arugula
1/4 cup slivered or sliced almonds

## Instructions
1. PREHEAT the oven to 425°F.
2. RINSE the beets thoroughly and carefully stab
all sides with a fork. 

3. Place in a medium bowl
and add 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, tossing
or mixing to thoroughly coat.
4.  Wrap each of the
oiled beets separately in aluminum foil, pinch-
ing the tops closed.
5.  Place the beets in the center
of a baking sheet and roast for 40 minutes.
Check the beets by carefully opening the foil
and sticking a thin knife into the center of a
beet. If it goes in easily, the beets are done. If
there’s resistance, close it back up and put the
beets back into the oven for 5 minutes. Repeat
until they’re done.
6. WHILE the beets are roasting, prepare the
vinaigrette. Whisk the grapefruit juice, garlic,
and mustard powder together in a small mixing
bowl. Add the remaining % cup of olive oil ina
steady stream while whisking to emulsify. Add
the thyme and season with the salt and pepper.
7. LET the beets cool until you’re able to handle
them. Remove the skin from each beet—you may
want to wear gloves, as beet juice will stain skin.
Dice the beets into 1-inch pieces and place in a
glass storage container with a lid. Refrigerate
for at least 30 minutes to chill before serving.
8. PLACE the arugula in a serving bowl, add the
beets and slivered almonds, and dress with the
vinaigrette.
