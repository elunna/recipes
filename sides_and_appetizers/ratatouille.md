Yield: 

## Ingredients
- 1/4 cup coconut oil or extra-virgin olive oil
- 1/4 onion, finely chopped
- 1 cup diced zucchini
- 1 cup diced yellow squash
- 1 cup diced eggplant
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1/2 cup finely diced green bell pepper
- 1/2 cup finely diced red bell pepper
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup Tomato Sauce
- 1 tsp balsamic vinegar
- 3 fresh basil leaves, roughly chopped (optional)

## Instructions
1. In a medium pot, heat the oil over medium heat, swirling to coat the bottom of the pot.
2. When the oil is hot, add the onion and cook, stirring, until translucent, 2 to 3 minutes.
3. Add the zucchini, yellow squash, and eggplant and season with the salt and pepper. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring often.
4. Add the green and red bell peppers and continue to cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring often.
5. Add the garlic and cook until aromatic, about 1 minute.
6. Add the tomato sauce and 1/2 cup water. Mix completely and bring to a simmer over low heat.
7. Cook, stirring occasionally, until all the vegetables are tender, about 25 minutes.
8. Transfer to a serving dish, casserole dish, or individual plates, sprinkle with the vinegar, and garnish with the basil, if desired.

### MAKE IT A MEAL: 
Make this a complete meal by adding homemade sausage or pre-cooked diced chicken during the last 10 minutes of cooking. Or serve with Perfect Poached Eggs, Chicken Meatballs, or Stuffed Peppers.

## Notes
Got leftovers? You will if you double this recipe! Ratatouille is equally delicious cold. Serve with eggs the next morning for breakfast, or mix in some cooked chicken or shrimp for an easy lunch.

### GRILLED RATATOUILLE
You can make ratatouille right on the grill.
- Preheat a grill to medium high (400Â°F)
- and prep all the vegetables, cutting the onion, green pepper, and red pepper into quarters and slicing the zucchini, squash,
and eggplant into long, thin strips.
- In a large bowl, coat the vegetables with the oil and season with salt and pepper.
- Place the eggplant on the grill first, cooking for 3 minutes.
- Then add the peppers and onion and cook for another 2 minutes.
- Finally, add the zucchini and squash and cook until everything is slightly charred and tender, about 5 more minutes. (Flip each vegetable once during cooking.)
- Place on a serving dish, top with warmed tomato sauce and basil, and serve.
