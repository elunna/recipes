# thai cucumber cup
--
Yield: 2 servings

## Ingredients
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp minced fresh ginger
- 1/2 jalapefio, seeded and minced
- Grated zest and juice of 2 limes
- 1/2 cup + 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- 1/2 cup cashews
- 1 cup roughly chopped button, cremini, or portabella mushrooms
- 1/4 cup finely diced red, yellow, or orange bell pepper
- 2 tbsp thinly sliced green onion
- 1 lb ground turkey
- 4 cucumbers, hollowed into cup
- 2 tbsp chopped fresh cilantro

## Instructions
1. To prepare the dressing, whisk together the garlic, ginger, jalapeno, and lime zest and juice in a medium non-reactive mixing bowl. Whisking, drizzle in 1/2 cup of the olive oil. Whisk in the salt and pepper. Set aside.
2. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add 1 tbsp of the olive oil and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan.
3. When the fat is hot, add the cashews and toast, shaking the pan to keep them from burning, until lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes.
4. Transfer to a cutting board, roughly chop, and let cool.
5. In the same skillet over medium-high heat, heat the remaining tbsp of olive oil.
6. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring, for 3 minutes.
7. Add the bell pepper, green onion, and turkey.
8. Cook, breaking up the turkey with a spatula or wooden spoon and mixing it into the vegetables, until the turkey is thoroughly browned, 7 to 10 minutes.
9. Remove the pan from the heat, add most of the dressing, and mix well.
10. Sprinkle the chopped cashews into the turkey mixture.
11. Spoon the turkey mixture into the cucumber cup and top with the chopped cilantro and a drizzle of the remaining dressing.

### CUCUMBER cup 
To make the cucumber cup, cut each cucumber into 3 logs (approximately 2 inches long). Scoop out the inner flesh using a small spoon or small melon baller, but don’t scoop out all the way through to the bottom, as the cup need to hold the meat mixture. Lightly salt the cucumber rounds and place on paper towels to drain.

## Notes
The cucumber cup make this dish the perfect appetizer, pot-luck contribution, or baby shower dish, but they may be too time-consuming for a mid-day lunch. The turkey, vegetable, and dressing mixture is just as tasty over a bed of crisp greens, wrapped in a romaine lettuce leaf, scooped into a bell pepper, or spooned on top of any of our breadless bun options.  It’s also delicious reheated in the morning (and topped with a fried egg or two).
