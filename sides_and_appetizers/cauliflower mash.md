---
Yield: 2 servings

## Ingredients
- 1 head cauliflower, cut into florets (about 4 cup)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 cup coconut cream
- 2 tbsp ghee or clarified butter
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- 1/2 cup chicken broth
- 1 tbsp minced fresh parsley

## Instructions
1. Bring 2 cup of water to a boil in a large pot over medium-high heat.
2. Add the cauliflower florets and garlic and simmer until the florets are fork-tender, about 15 minutes.
3. Drain the cauliflower and transfer to a food processor.
4. Add the coconut cream, ghee, salt, and pepper and pulse until the cauliflower begins to turn smooth in consistency.
5. Add the chicken broth one tbsp at a time, pulsing to mix, until the desired consistency is achieved.
6. Add the parsley and continue blending until completely smooth.
7. Serve warm.

### MAKE IT A MEAL: 
This dish goes well with anything.  Seriously, anything. But if you made us pick a few favorites, we'd say Braised Beef Brisket, Chicken Meatballs, Halibut with Citrus-Ginger Glaze, and Walnut-Crusted Pork Tenderloin.

### MASHING 
You can use a variety of tools for this dish, depending on how you prefer the texture of your mash. If you preter a silky smooth mash, the food processor is a must.  If you like it really chunky, use a hand tool (like a potato masher or large kitchen fork) instead. If you like your mash somewhere in between, try using an immersion blender.

## Notes

This may be the most versatile recipe ever. It’s a lighter substitute for mashed potatoes, and has dozens of variations to match nearly any style of cuisine.

- Add more chicken broth if you like it extra creamy, or keep the chicken broth to just a tbsp or so if you prefer it really thick.
- Try topping with crumbled Whole30-compliant bacon or crispy prosciutto;
- add a blend of fresh herbs like rosemary, oregano, and thyme;
- kick it up a notch with 2 tbsp of grated, peeled fresh horseradish root or 1 tsp chili powder;
- add a dollop of whole grain mustard (perfect alongside pork);
- or stir in shredded cabbage and kale sautéed in clarified butter or ghee.
