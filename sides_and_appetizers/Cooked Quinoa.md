# Cooked Quinoa
---
Before cooking, quinoa must be rinsed well — twice — to
remove the toxic but naturally occurring coating saponin.

Yield: 4 cups

## Ingredients
1 cup quinoa, rinsed and drained twice
2 cups water

## Instructions
1. Place the quinoa in a saucepan and pour in the water. 
2. Cover and bring to a boil. 
3. Reduce the heat and simmer, covered, for
15 minutes or until all the water has been absorbed. 
4. Remove
the pan from the heat and let it stand for 5 minutes, covered.

5. Fluff the quinoa with a fork. Divide into 1-cup portions and
freeze for up to 6 months (or store in the fridge for 4-5 days)
