Yield: 6 servings
Prep time: 30min

## Ingredients
- 3 lbs. yukon gold potatoes
- 4 tbsp. ghee
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- approx. 1 cup chicken stock or vegetable stock
- 3/4 cup unsweetened, full fat coconut milk 
- Kosher salt, to taste
- black pepper, to taste

## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of water to boil.
2. Cut the potatoes into fourths. I like to leave the skins on, but feel free to peel the potatoes if you prefer no skins.
3. When the water is boiling, add the potatoes to the water and continue to boil for 15-20 minutes, until the potatoes are tender and a fork is easily inserted and removed from the potato.
4. Drain the potatoes in a colander, and leave in the colander until the potatoes are just slightly steaming (this helps them be less watery).
5. Meanwhile, melt the ghee in the pot and saute the garlic for 2 minutes, being careful not to burn. Remove from heat.
6. Return the potatoes back to the pot. Start by adding only 1/2 cup of chicken stock and the coconut milk, and start mashing with a potato masher. You want the potatoes to become smooth and velvety. Continue adding chicken stock until the potatoes are smooth with no lumps. Mine only took 1 cup chicken stock, but it will depend on your potatoes and the consistency you like them (I prefer mine a little lumpy, but just keep mashing more if you like yours smoother and add more broth if you think they are too dry).
7. Add plenty of salt and pepper, to taste, to season the potatoes.
