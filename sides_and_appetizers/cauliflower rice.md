# cauliflower rice
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
- 1 large head cauliflower, cut into florets
- 3 tbsp ghee or clarified butter
- 1/2 onion, finely chopped
- 1 carrot, peeled and finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 cup chicken broth
- 1 tbsp minced cilantro
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper

## Instructions
1. TO “rice” the cauliflower, place half of the florets in a food
processor and pulse into a rice-like consistency, 15 to 20
pulses. (Don’t over-crowd the cauliflower in the food pro-
cessor, and don’t over-pulse or the florets will get mushy.)
Repeat to rice the remaining florets.
2. IN a large skillet, melt the ghee over medium heat and
swirl to coat the bottom of the pan. When the ghee is hot,
add the onion and carrot and cook, stirring, until the onion
is translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook
until the garlic is aromatic, about 1 minute.
3. ADD the riced cauliflower to the skillet and mix thoroughly
with the rest of the vegetables. Add the chicken broth,
cover the pan with a lid, and steam until you’ve arrived at
a rice-like consistency, 10 to 12 minutes. (The cauliflower
should be tender, but not mushy or wet.)
4. REMOVE the pan from the heat and mix in the chopped
cilantro. Adjust the seasoning with the salt and pepper.

MAKE IT A MEAL: Like its mashed counterpart, this
cauliflower dish goes with anything. Try it with meals that
include a sauce, like Grilled Coconut-Curry Chicken (page
230), Romesco Garlic Shrimp (page 244), and Pulled Pork
Carnitas (page 254).

### GRATIN
If you don’t have a food processor, you can
use a box grater to shred the cauliflower into rice. Patience,
however, as it will take quite a while! You can also make
tried “rice” by omitting the chicken broth, adding more
cooking fat to the pan, and pan-frying the rice until tender,
about 5 minutes. For an even more authentic fried rice
experience, stir two egg whites into the cauliflower while
pan-frying.

## Notes

This is another incredibly versatile recipe.
Make a Moroccan-style rice by adding
1/4 cup slivered almonds or pine nuts,
1/2 cup raisins, 1/2 tsp ground cumin,
1/4 tsp ground turmeric, and
1/4 tsp ground cinnamon. Make
rice Asian-style by adding 2 tbsp
coconut aminos (a soy sauce substitute,
see page 320 for details), 1 tsp
sesame oil, and 2 minced green onions.
Or make this a complete meal by adding
a serving of your favorite chopped
protein (like chicken, shrimp, flank
steak, or pork) and any leftover sautéed
vegetables you have in your fridge.
