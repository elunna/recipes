# pan-roasted brussels sprouts and squash
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
- 3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- 1/2 lb Brussels sprouts, trimmed and cut in half
- 1/2 red onion, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1 tsp dried sage
- 1/2 tsp nutmeg
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 3 cup diced peeled butternut squash

## Instructions
1. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan.
2. When the oil is hot, add the Brussels sprouts and onion and season with the sage, nutmeg, pepper, and salt.
3. Cover and cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until the sprouts begin to brown, 5 to 7 minutes.
4. Turn the sprouts and add the squash and cook everything until the squash is fork-tender, an additional 7 to 10 minutes.
5. Transfer to a serving dish or plates and serve immediately.

### MAKE IT A MEAL:
When you add the squash to the pan, add cooked sausage, chicken sausage, or chicken to make it a complete meal. Or serve with Steak Salad, Grilled Coconut-Curry Chicken, or Walnut- Crusted Pork Tenderloin.

## Notes
One large squash usually yields 2 1/2 to 3 cup, so just buy a big one and call it good — no need to measure precisely for this recipe. You can also substitute any winter squash for butternut: this dish would be great with delicata, acorn, kabocha, or buttercup. Not winter squash season? Use 2 peeled, large-diced sweet potatoes or apples instead. Serving company? Add crumbled Whole30-compliant bacon or prosciutto and pomegranate seeds as a garnish.

### OVEN-ROASTED SPROUTS AND SQUASH
You can also make this meal in the oven and free your stovetop for other
dishes.
- First, skip cutting the Brussels sprouts in half—just trim the ends and leave them whole.
- Preheat the oven to 350°F.
- In a large mixing bowl, combine the Brussels sprouts, onion, and butternut squash.
- Add the olive oil and stir or toss until all the vegetables are well coated.
- Spread the vegetables ona parchment paper-lined baking tray and sprinkle with the sage, nutmeg, pepper, and salt.
- Roast in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes, until the Brussels sprouts and squash are fork-tender.
