# pan-roasted brussels sprouts and squash
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
1/2 pound Brussels sprouts, trimmed
and cut in half
1/2 red onion, cut into 1-inch pieces
1 teaspoon dried sage
1/2 teaspoon nutmeg
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon salt
3 cups diced peeled butternut squash


## Instructions
1. HEAT the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat and
swirl to coat the bottom of the pan. When the oil is hot,
add the Brussels sprouts and onion and season with the
sage, nutmeg, pepper, and salt. Cover and cook, shaking
the pan occasionally, until the sprouts begin to brown,
5 to 7 minutes. Turn the sprouts and add the squash and
cook everything until the squash is fork-tender, an addi-
tional 7 to 10 minutes.
2. TRANSFER to a serving dish or plates and serve
immediately.

MAKE IT A MEAL: When you add the squash to the pan,
add cooked sausage, chicken sausage, or chicken to make
it a complete meal. Or serve with Steak Salad (page 220),
Grilled Coconut-Curry Chicken (page 230), or Walnut-
Crusted Pork Tenderloin (page 252).

## Notes

One large squash usually yields 2 1/2 to
3 cups, so just buy a big one and call it
good—no need to measure precisely for
this recipe. You can also substitute any
winter squash for butternut: this dish
would be great with delicata, acorn,
kabocha, or buttercup. Not winter
squash season? Use 2 peeled, large-
diced sweet potatoes or apples instead.
Serving company? Add crumbled
Whole30-compliant bacon or prosciutto
and pomegranate seeds as a garnish.

### OVEN-ROASTED SPROUTS AND SQUASH
You can also
make this meal in the oven and free your stovetop for other
dishes. First, skip cutting the Brussels sprouts in half—just
trim the ends and leave them whole. Preheat the oven to
350°F. In a large mixing bowl, combine the Brussels sprouts,
onion, and butternut squash. Add the olive oil and stir or toss
until all the vegetables are well coated. Spread the vegetables
ona parchment paper-lined baking tray and sprinkle with the
sage, nutmeg, pepper, and salt. Roast in the oven for 30 to 40
minutes, until the Brussels sprouts and squash are fork-tender.
