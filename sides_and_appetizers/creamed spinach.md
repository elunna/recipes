Yield: 

## Ingredients
- 2 packages (10 oz each) frozen spinach, thawed
- 2 tbsp clarified butter or ghee
- 1/2 onion, finely diced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 can (13.5 oz) full-fat coconut milk
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper

## Instructions
1. Drain the thawed spinach by placing it in a colander over the sink and wringing the spinach out with your hands (like youâ€™re wringing out laundry). You can also place a clean dishtowel or paper towels over the top of the spinach and press hard, until the excess water is gone and the spinach is relatively dry.
2. Melt the cooking fat in a large skillet over medium heat, swirling to coat the bottom of the pan.
3. When the fat is hot, add the onion and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.
4. Add the garlic and cook until aromatic, about 1 minute. 
5. Add the spinach and mix well with a wooden spoon or spatula.
6. Add the coconut milk, salt, and pepper and increase the heat to medium high.
7. Bring to a boil, cook until the coconut milk thickens, 5 to 6 minutes. 
8. Serve warm.
