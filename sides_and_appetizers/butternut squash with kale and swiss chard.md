# Butternut squash with kale and swiss chard
---
Yield: 2 servings

## Ingredients
2 cup large-diced seeded peeled butternut squash
1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
1 bunch kale, stemmed, leaves cut into 1-inch ribbons
1 bunch Swiss chard, stemmed, leaves cut into 1-inch ribbons
3 tbsp clarified butter, ghee, or coconut oil
1 tbsp garlic, minced
1/4 cup raw sliced almonds
1/2 tsp chili powder
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp black pepper

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 425F.
2. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
3. In a large bowl, toss or mix the butternut squash with the olive oil until well coated. Place the squash on the baking sheet and roast for 45-50 min, until fork-tender.
4. ~15 min before the squash is done, bring 2 cup of water to a boil in a large pot.
5. Place a colander or steamer inside the pot. Add the kale and Swiss chard, cover, and steam until the kale is tender but not soft, 3-5 min.
6. Remove the kale and chard from the pot and set aside. Drain the pot and wipe it out.
7. Place the same pot over medium heat, add the cooking fat, and swirl to coat the bottom. 
8. When the fat is hot, add the garlic and almonds and stir until the garlic is aromatic, ~1 min.
9. Raise the heat to high and add the steamed kale and Swiss chard. Toss for 20-30 seconds to combine, then remove from the heat and transfer everything from the pot to a serving dish.
10. Combine the roasted butternut squash with the kale and chard mixture. Add the chili powder, salt, and pepper, toss to combine, and serve immediately.

## Notes

Serve as a breakfast with a few fried eggs on top.

"Stemming" kale: same technique as removing rosemary or thyme leaves.

Make it a meal: Add some cooked chicken sausage, ground beef, or roasted chicken. Or serve with Oven-baked salmon, or grilled coconut-curry chicken.
