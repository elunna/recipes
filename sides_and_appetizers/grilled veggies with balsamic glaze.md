# grilled veggies with balsamic glaze
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
- 1 cup balsamic vinegar
- 1 bunch asparagus, ends trimmed, cut into 1-inch pieces
- 1 zucchini, cut into large dice
- 1 yellow squash, cut into large dice
- 1 sweet or yellow onion, cut into 1-inch slices
- 2 bell peppers, seeded, ribs removed, and cut into 1-inch slices
- 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 2 tbsp finely chopped fresh parsley

## Instructions
1. TO make the balsamic glaze, bring the vinegar
to a boil in a small saucepan over medium-high
heat. Turn the heat down to medium low and
simmer until the balsamic is reduced by about
half, 20 to 30 minutes. Remove from the heat,
allow to cool, and reserve. (You can do this up to
a week ahead of time; store in a covered con-
tainer at room temperature.)
2. TO grill the vegetables, preheat the grill to high
heat (500°F).
3. PLACE the asparagus, zucchini, squash, onion,
and peppers in a large bowl and drizzle in half
the olive oil. Toss or mix the vegetables with
your hands until they are well coated, place in a
grill basket.
4. PLACE the basket on the grill and close the lid.
Grill for 15 to 20 minutes, shaking the grill bas-
ket occasionally. You’re done when the peppers
and onions are charred on the edges and tender
enough to eat.
5. PLACE the vegetables in a serving bowl. Drizzle
evenly with 1/4 cup of the balsamic glaze and
the remaining olive oil. Season with the salt
and pepper and garnish with the parsley. Serve
warm or at room temperature.


## Notes

### GRILL TECHNIQUES 
If you've got decent grill
experience (or an extra set of hands to help), you
can slice the vegetables and grill them right on the
slats, as described in the technique on page 164.
It’s a little more work, but this method will impart
those pretty char marks on your vegetables (as in
our photo on page 358) and lets you throw some
fruit (like slices of pineapple or mango) into the
mix, too.
