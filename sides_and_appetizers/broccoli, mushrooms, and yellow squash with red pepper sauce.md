# broccoli, mushrooms, and yellow squash with red pepper sauce
---
Yield: 2 servings

## Ingredients
- 1 head broccoli, cut into florets
- 2 tbsp coconut oil or extra-virgin olive oil
- 1/4 small onion, finely chopped
- 1/2 pt button, cremini, or portabella mushrooms, quartered
- 1 medium yellow squash, cut into large dice
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- Salt and black pepper
- 1/4 cup Roasted Red Pepper Sauce

## Instructions
1. Bring 1 cup of water to a boil in a large pot.
2. Place a colander or steamer inside the pot.
3. Add the broccoli, cover, and steam until the broccoli is fork tender, 5 to 6 minutes.
4. Remove the broccoli from the pot and set aside.
5. While you wait for the water to boil, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat, swirling to coat the bottom of the pan.
6. When the oil is hot, add the onion and mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is translucent, 2 to 3 minutes.
7. Add the yellow squash and garlic and continue to cook, stirring, until the squash is slightly softened, about 5 minutes.
8. Remove the pan from the heat.
9. Add the broccoli to the skillet and toss with the squash mixture.
10. Lightly dust with salt and pepper, as the Roasted Red Pepper Sauce is also seasoned.
11. Transfer the contents of the pan to a serving bowl or individual plates and top with the Roasted Red Pepper Sauce.

### MAKE IT A MEAL:
You could add just about any protein to this dish—it’s the perfect “ingredient” meal, with a sauce that pulls it all together. It goes especially well with fried eggs, burgers, or Perfect Seared Chicken Breasts.

### BROCCOLI STALK SOUP
Don’t waste those broccoli stems! You can use them to make a creamy, delicious soup.
1. First, peel the stems and slice them into thin coins.
2. Heat 1 tbsp coconut oil, clarified butter, or ghee in a medium pot, then add half a chopped onion, 2 cloves minced garlic, 1 cup sliced mushrooms, and the broccoli stems.
3. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
4. Add 1 cup chicken broth and 1 cup full-fat coconut milk to the pot, stir, and pull the pot off the heat.
5. Allow to cool for 5 minutes, then transfer the contents of the pot to a blender or food processor and blend until smooth, 20 to 30 seconds. Season with salt and pepper.

## Notes
Save prep time by making the Roasted Red Pepper Sauce up to 2 days ahead of time. You could also sprinkle 1 tbsp red pepper flakes over the vegetables when you add the garlic, add your favorite Whole30-compliant salad dressing when serving, or top with the Ranch Dressing, Chimichurri, or Curry Sauce. Note, the squash and mushrooms will give off quite a bit of water while cooking, and will continue to “shed” even after you transfer them to a serving dish. To avoid a watery side dish, use a slotted spoon to remove the vegetables from the pan.
