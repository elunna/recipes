# broccoli, mushrooms, and yellow squash with red pepper sauce
---
Yield: 2 servings

## Ingredients
- 1 head broccoli, cut into florets
- 2 tbsp coconut oil or extra-virgin olive oil
- 1/4 small onion, finely chopped
- 1/2 pt button, cremini, or portabella mushrooms, quartered
- 1 medium yellow squash, cut into large dice
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- Salt and black pepper
- 1/4 cup Roasted Red Pepper Sauce (page 316)

## Instructions
1. BRING 1 cup of water to a boil in a large pot. Place a col-
ander or steamer inside the pot. Add the broccoli, cover,
and steam until the broccoli is fork tender, 5 to 6 minutes.
Remove the broccoli from the pot and set aside.
2. WHILE you wait for the water to boil, heat the oil in a large
skillet over medium heat, swirling to coat the bottom of the
pan. When the oil is hot, add the onion and mushrooms
and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is trans-
lucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the yellow squash and garlic
and continue to cook, stirring, until the squash is slightly
softened, about 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat.
3. ADD the broccoli to the skillet and toss with the squash
mixture. Lightly dust with salt and pepper, as the Roasted
Red Pepper Sauce is also seasoned. Transfer the contents
of the pan to a serving bowl or individual plates and top
with the Roasted Red Pepper Sauce.

### MAKE IT A MEAL:
You could add just about any protein
to this dish—it’s the perfect “ingredient” meal, with a sauce
that pulls it all together. It goes especially well with fried
eggs (see page 149), burgers (see page 153), or Perfect
Seared Chicken Breasts (page 157).

### BROCCOLI
Don’t waste those broccoli stems! You can
use them to make a creamy, delicious soup. First, peel the
stems and slice them into thin coins. Heat 1 tbsp
coconut oil, clarified butter, or ghee in a medium pot, then
add half a chopped onion, 2 cloves minced garlic, 1 cup sliced
mushrooms, and the broccoli stems. Cook for 10 minutes,
stirring occasionally. Add 1 cup chicken broth and 1 cup full-
fat coconut milk to the pot, stir, and pull the pot off the heat.
Allow to cool for 5 minutes, then transfer the contents of the
pot to a blender or food processor and blend until smooth,
20 to 30 seconds. Season with salt and pepper.

## Notes

Save prep time by making the Roasted
Red Pepper Sauce up to 2 days
ahead of time. You could also sprinkle
1 tbsp red pepper flakes over the
vegetables when you add the garlic,
add your favorite Whole30-compliant
salad dressing when serving, or top
with the Ranch Dressing (page 316),
Chimichurri (page 306), or Curry Sauce
(page 307). Note, the squash and
mushrooms will give off quite a bit of
water while cooking, and will continue
to “shed” even after you transfer them
to a serving dish. To avoid a watery
side dish, use a slotted spoon to
remove the vegetables from the pan.
