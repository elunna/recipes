# Cooked Buckwheat
---
Yield: 8 CUPS

## Ingredients

2 cups raw buckwheat groats
3 cups Homemade Stock (page 42) or water
1/2 teaspoon sea Salt

## Instructions
1. Soak the buckwheat overnight in plenty of water (buckwheat
is thirsty stuff). The next day, rinse well, drain and plonk in a
Saucepan with the stock or water, and the salt.
2. Bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer and cook for about
8 minutes, until all the water is absorbed. When done, allow
to sit for 5 minutes with the lid on and then fluff with a fork.
Divide into 1/2-cup servings and freeze for up to 3 months.

## Notes

- Put yours on to soak just before bed.
- Buckwheat is relatively high in phytase (the good enzyme that breaks down phytic acid), so keep the soak time to 7-8 hours max, or it will become too mushy. Bear in mind a bit of musiness is normal, though.








Make it faster: Instead of soaking, you can also reduce some of the phytic acid by toasting the groats in a dry frying pan (no oil) over medium-low heat for 5 minutes before adding the water. Cook for 15 minutes.
