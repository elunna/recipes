# Steamed Garlic Green Beans
---
Yield: 4 servings
Prep time: 15 min

## Ingredients

1 lb green beans, stem ends removed
1 garlic clove, smashed and peeled
1 tbsp butter, cut up
Coarse salt

## Instructions
1. Place beans, garlic, butter, and cup water in a 2- to 2 1/2-qt shallow microwave-safe dish with a lid; season with salt.

2. Cover, and microwave on high until beans are crisp-tender, 6 to 7 minutes. Stir, and pour off any excess liquid.

### How to Trim Green Beans
Unless you've purchased your beans pre-trimmed, you'll need to trim off the stem ends before cooking. To identify the end we're talking about, look for a tough, knobby bit on one end, opposite the more tender, tapered end. To prep them quickly and efficiently, line up a handful of beans on your cutting board with the stem ends all facing the same direction. Hold the beans in place with one hand (far enough away from the blade) and cut off the ends right where they meet the beans. While you're at it, be sure to trim off any ends that are broken or look dry or brown.

Since microwave times can vary between brands, you may want to begin checking the beans after five minutes to ensure they don't overcook.

## Notes

This simple, three-ingredient side dish is ready in under 15 minutes.

Steaming green beans in the microwave results in crisp-tender beans bathed in a simple garlic-butter sauce, and takes under 15 minutes from start to finish. To make this recipe, you'll combine trimmed green beans with a bit of water, some butter, and a smashed garlic clove in a covered, microwave-safe container. After six to seven minutes in the microwave, the beans will be bright green and just tender enough without being mushy. The garlic and butter adds a touch of richness and flavor, and all that's needed is a pinch of salt to finish things off.

This recipe is perfect for nights when you need to get dinner on the table quickly or when your stovetop is already maxed out. Healthy and simple, it's one you'll want to keep in your back pocket.

Variations
To jazz up these beans further, try adding a few shakes of lemon-pepper seasoning or cajun seasoning in place of the salt. You can also add a small splash of soy sauce or teriyaki sauce in place of the salt before cooking. For a touch of freshness, garnish the cooked beans with chopped herbs (try tarragon or chives) and/or a squeeze of lemon.
