# Cheddar-Jalapeno Cornbread
---
Yield: 8 servings
Prep time: 30 min

## Ingredients

1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted, plus more, room temperature, for pan
1 1/2 cup yellow or white cornmeal
1 cup all-purpose flour (spooned and leveled)
6 tbsp sugar
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
1 tsp fine salt
1/2 tsp baking soda
1 cup buttermilk
3 large eggs
1 1/2 cup grated sharp cheddar
3/4 cup fresh or frozen corn kernels
1/3 cup chopped drained pickled jalapenos

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Butter an 8-inch square baking pan. In a large bowl, stir together cornmeal, flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and baking soda. In a medium bowl, whisk together melted butter, buttermilk, and eggs. Add buttermilk mixture to flour mixture and stir just until combined (do not overmix). Stir 1 1/4 cup grated cheddar, corn kernels, and jalapenos into batter. Transfer batter to pan and smooth top. Top with 1/4 cup grated cheddar.
2. Bake until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool in pan on a wire rack, 15 minutes, before serving.
3. 

## Notes

Our Classic Cornbread strikes the right balance between tender and crumbly. Here, we've jazzed up the batter with addition of sharp cheddar and spicy jalapenos.
