# green beans with fig vinaigrette
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
### FIG VINAIGRETTE
- 1/4 cup white wine vinegar or champagne vinegar
- 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
- 1/2 tsp mustard powder
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 1/4 cup dried figs, finely chopped (5 to 6 figs)
- 2 tsp minced fresh thyme leaves
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper

### GREEN BEANS
- 2 cup ice
- 2 tbsp salt
- 1 lb green beans, trimmed
- 2 tbsp cooking fat
- 1/4 cup slivered almonds


## Instructions
1. TO MAKE THE VINAIGRETTE:
Whisk together the white wine vinegar, balsamic vin-
egar, mustard powder, and garlic in a medium
bowl. Continue to whisk while slowly drizzling
in the olive oil. Stir in the figs and thyme and
season with the salt and pepper.
2. TO MAKE THE GREEN BEANS:
Create an ice bath for “shocking” the beans by filling a large
bowl halfway with cokd-water, then adding the ice.
3. COMBINE 3 cup of water and the salt in a large
saucepan and bring to a boil over high heat.

4. Add the green beans and blanch for 20 seconds.
Using kitchen tongs or a slotted spoon, immedi-
ately transfer the beans to the ice bath to shock. As soon as the green beans are chilled (about 1 minute), transfer to a colander and drain.
5. MELT the cooking fat in a large skillet over
medium-high heat, swirling to coat the bottom
of the pan. 
6. When the fat is hot, add the slivered
almonds and toast for 30 seconds, shaking
the pan often so they don’t burn. 
7. Remove the
almonds from the pan and reserve. 
8. Add the
green beans, tossing to coat in the cooking fat.
Cook, shaking the pan often, until the beans are
crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. (The easiest way
to check for doneness is to taste them.)
9. TRANSFER the beans to a serving dish, sprinkle
on the toasted almonds, and drizzle lightly with
1/4 cup of the vinaigrette (add more if desired,
but a little goes a long way here). Toss until
evenly dressed. Serve immediately.
