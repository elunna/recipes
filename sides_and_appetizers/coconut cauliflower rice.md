# coconut cauliflower rice
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
- 1 head cauliflower, cut into florets
- 2 tbsp coconut oil, ghee, or clarified butter
- 1/4 onion, finely chopped
- 1 cup coconut milk
- 1/4 cup shredded coconut flakes
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper
- 1 tbsp finely chopped cilantro

## Instructions
1. To “rice” the cauliflower florets, pulse in a food processor until they turn into small, ricelike pieces, 20 to 25 pulses. (You'll want to do this in two batches. Don’t overcrowd the cauliflower in the food processor, and don’t over-pulse or the florets will get mushy.)
2. In a large skillet, melt the cooking fat over medium heat and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan.
3. When the fat is hot, add the onion and cook, stirring, until translucent, 2 to 3 minutes.
4. Add the riced cauliflower and coconut milk and mix thoroughly.
5. Cover and steam until the coconut milk has been absorbed by the rice and the cauliflower is tender, about 10 minutes. (The best way to test for doneness is to eat a bite!)
6. Scrape up any brown bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon and mix into the rice.
7. Remove the pan from the heat and mix in the shredded coconut, salt, and pepper.
8. Gently stir in the chopped cilantro and serve warm.
