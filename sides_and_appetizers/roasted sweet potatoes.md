# roasted sweet potatoes
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
- 2 medium sweet potatoes
- 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- 2 tbsp clarified butter, ghee, or coconut butter
- Salt and black pepper

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 375°F.
2. Wash the sweet potatoes thoroughly and pat dry.
3. With a fork or paring knife, carefully puncture all sides of each potato.
4. Rub the olive oil evenly over the skin.
5. Wrap each sweet potato securely in foil, sealing the foil on top.
6. Place on a baking sheet and roast for 30 minutes.
7. Starting at the 30 minute mark, insert a fork or knife into the center of the potato every 5 minutes; they are done when they are very soft and tender. (Depending on the size of the potatoes, this may take up to 1 hour.)
8. Remove the foil and cut the sweet potatoes open length-wise.
9. Keeping the skin on, add 1 tbsp of butter to each sweet potato, scraping the flesh gently with a fork so the butter melts into the flesh.
10. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

### MAKE IT A MEAL: 
This simple but delicious side goes well with just about anything. We think it complements Braised Beef Brisket, Grilled Coconut-Curry Chicken, Cod with Mushroom and Red Pepper Relish, or Pork Chops With Spiced Applesauce. Or, stuff a roasted sweet potato with Pulled Pork Carnitas and top with our Avocado Mayonnaise.

### COMPOUND BUTTER 
A compound butter would be a delicious addition to this simple side dish. Some combinations to consider: 2 tsp chopped rosemary leaves and % cup chopped, toasted pecans; % tsp each cinnamon and nutmeg, % cup chopped toasted walnuts, and % cup chopped raisins; or 2 cloves minced garlic with 2 tsp each chopped rosemary, thyme, and sage.

## Notes
You can also slice your sweet potatoes into long “spears” before roasting—these are perfect for dipping! Add the spears to a bowl with the olive oil and mix to coat. Place the spears in one layer on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and roast as directed, about 40 minutes, until the edges are brown but not burned. These pair well with Ranch Dressing, Garlic Aioli, or Sunshine Sauce.
