# balsamic roasted sweet potatoes and brussels sprouts
---
Yield: 2 servings

## Ingredients
- 1 cup alsamic vinegar
- 1 sweet potato, peeled and cut into large dice
- 3 tbsp melted ghee, clarified butter, coconut oil, or extra-virgin olive oil
- 1/2 lb Brussels sprouts, trimmed and cut in half
- 1/2 red onion, thinly sliced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper

## Instructions
1. PREHEAT the oven to 400°F. Line a baking sheet with
parchment paper.
2. BRING the vinegar to a boil in a small saucepan over
medium-high heat. Turn the heat down to medium low
and simmer until the balsamic is reduced by about half,
20 to 30 minutes. Remove from the heat, allow to cool, and
reserve. (You can do this up to a week ahead of time; store
in a covered container at room temperature.)
3. WHILE the glaze is reducing, combine the sweet potato
and 1 tbsp of the cooking fat in a medium bowl and
stir or toss to coat evenly. Spread the coated sweet pota-
toes on the prepared baking sheet.
4. MEANWHILE, add the remaining 2 tbsp of fat to
a large skillet over medium-high heat and swirl to coat the
bottom of the pan. When the fat is hot, add the Brussels
sprouts and cook, shaking the pan occasionally as they
start to brown, for 3 to 4 minutes. Add the onion and garlic
and continue to cook, stirring, until the garlic is aromatic,
an additional minute. Season with the salt and pepper.
5. ADD the Brussels sprout mixture to the sweet potatoes on
the pan, spreading them evenly without crowding. Put the
baking sheet in the oven and roast for 15 to 18 minutes,
until the sweet potatoes are golden brown and soft and the
sprouts are tender.
6. PLATE the Brussels sprouts and sweet potato mixture and
drizzle with the balsamic sauce.

### MAKE IT A MEAL
Make this a complete breakfast in
no time! In the same skillet you used to cook the sprouts
and onion, pan-fry some chicken sausage or eggs while
the vegetables are roasting. This dish is also the perfect
accompaniment to a whole roasted chicken (see page 157), Pork
Chops with Spiced Applesauce (page 258), and Grilled Steak with
Garlic-Shallot Puree and Avocado (page 216).

### BRUSSELS SPROUT SHIPS
One of the best parts of roasted Brussels
sprouts are the leaves that fall off the sprout and crisp up like a chip in
the oven. You can “help” this process along by picking offa few outer
leaves of each sprout after adding them to the baking sheet.


## Notes

When it comes to sauces and dressings
you might think more is better, but that’s
not the case with a balsamic glaze! The
flavor is so strong, you really do only
want a thin drizzle over your vegetables.
Better to err on the side of caution and
under-dress than to add too much and
overwhelm the fresh flavors of this dish.
