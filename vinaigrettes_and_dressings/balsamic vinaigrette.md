## Notes

This dressing is used in our Walnut-Crusted Pork Ten-
derloin (page 252), and also makes a great topping
for grilled vegetables (see page 164), white fish, and
salads. We also like to make a creamy variation (sub
in Basic Mayonnaise, page 179, for the olive oil) and
use it as a dip for a raw vegetable tray, drizzle it over
Oven-Roasted Brussels Sprouts and Squash (page
286), or mix it into a Protein Salad (page 161).
