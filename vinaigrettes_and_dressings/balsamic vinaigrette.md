# balsamic vinaigrette
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
- 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tsp mustard powder
- 3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 tsp minced fresh cilantro (or 1/4 tsp dried)
- Salt and black pepper

## Instructions
1. Mix together the vinegar, garlic, and mustard powder in a small bowl. 
2. Add the olive oil in a steady stream while whisking to emulsify. 
3. Add the cilantro, adjust to taste with salt and pepper, and whisk until fully incorporated.

## Notes

This dressing is used in our Walnut-Crusted Pork Tenderloin, and also makes a great topping for grilled vegetables, white fish, and salads. We also like to make a creamy variation (sub in Basic Mayonnaise, for the olive oil) and use it as a dip for a raw vegetable tray, drizzle it over Oven-Roasted Brussels Sprouts and Squash, or mix it into a Protein Salad.
