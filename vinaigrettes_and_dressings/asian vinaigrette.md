Yield: 

## Ingredients
- 1/4 cup rice vinegar
- 1 tbsp sesame oil
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1/2 tsp minced fresh ginger
- 3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- Red pepper flakes
- Salt and black pepper

## Instructions
1. Mix together the rice vinegar, sesame oil, garlic, and ginger in a small bowl. 
2. Add the olive oil in a steady stream while whisking to emulsify.
3. Adjust the seasoning with a pinch of red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper and whisk until fully incorporated.

## Notes
This makes a great alternative dressing for our Cold Thai Salad. A creamy variation (use Basic Mayonnaise, instead of olive oil) can be mixed into Cauliflower Rice or spooned over Perfect Oven-Baked Salmon.
