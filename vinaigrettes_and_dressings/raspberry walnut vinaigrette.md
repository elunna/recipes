# raspberry walnut vinaigrette
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
- 1/2 cup fresh raspberries, finely chopped or smashed
- 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
- 2 tbsp finely chopped walnuts
- 1 tsp minced fresh cilantro (or 1/4 tsp dried)
- 3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- Salt and black pepper

## Instructions
1. Mix together the raspberries, vinegar, walnuts, and cilantro in a small bowl.
2. Drizzle in the olive oil while whisking steadily to emulsify. 
3. Adjust to taste with salt and pepper and whisk until fully blended.

## Notes
This dressing is used in our Harvest Grilled Chicken Salad, but itâ€™s also delicious on a summer salad of baby spinach, chopped berries (blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, and raspberries), and diced cucumbers, or mix it into any variation of a Protein Salad. You can also swap out the raspberries for a different berry in this recipe, or use crushed pomegranate seeds in the winter.
