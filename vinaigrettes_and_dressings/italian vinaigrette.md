Yield: 

## Ingredients
- 1/4 cup red wine vinegar
- 2 tbsp minced fresh oregano (or 2 tsp dried)
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 tsp mustard powder
- 3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp black pepper

## Instructions
1. Mix together the vinegar, oregano, garlic, and mustard powder in a small bowl. 
2. Add the olive oil in a steady stream while whisking to emulsify. 
3. Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper and whisk until fully incorporated.

## Notes
This is a great marinade for chicken or shrimp, or it can be used instead of the lemon oil in our Green Cabbage Slaw.
