YOU COULD easily change the flavor of
this sauce by substituting the same amount of
sundried tomatoes or roasted eggplant for the
roasted red peppers, or try black olives to make a
tapenade-like spread for vegetables or meat.

## Notes

We tell you to pair this sauce with the Broccoli,
Mushrooms, and Yellow Squash on page 264, but
when we “road tested” the recipe, we ended up
putting the sauce on everything—fried eggs in the
morning, our burger at lunch, and roasted cauliflower
at dinner. Double this recipe—you'll thank us.
