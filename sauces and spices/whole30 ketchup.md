# whole30 ketchup
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients
1 cup tomato paste
1/2 cup apple cider
1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon ground cloves (optional)

## Instructions
1. HEAT a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the
tomato paste, apple cider, and vinegar. Stir completely and
let it come to a simmer, but do not allow to boil.
2. ADD the garlic powder, salt, and cloves and cook, stirring
frequently to prevent scorching—you may need to turn the
heat down to low or simmer here. Simmer until the ketchup
has thickened enough to evenly coat the back of a spoon,
5 to 8 minutes. Remove from the heat and allow to cool.
Serve when cool, or store refrigerated in an air-tight con-
tainer; itll keep for up to 2 weeks.

## Notes
Don’t expect the familiar “Heinz 57”
from this recipe—grocery store ketchup is
thick and sweet thanks to sugar—nearly
4 grams per tablespoon. In fact, Heinz 57
uses both high-fructose corn syrup and
corn syrup to sweeten their paste. We
could use date paste to make our ketchup
sugary, but that’s not really in line with
the spirit of the Whole30. This ketchup
will have more of a lighter vinegar
flavor, different but still delicious on eggs,
burgers, and baked potato “fries.”
