# hollandaise
---
Yield: 

## Ingredients

1 1/2 cups clarified unsalted butter or ghee
4 large egg yolks
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1 teaspoon salt
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)


## Instructions
1. IN a medium saucepan over low heat, melt the butter or
ghee until warm but not bubbling.
2. COMBINE the egg yolks, lemon juice, salt, and cayenne
pepper (if you like) in a food processor or blender and
pulse 10 to 15 times to combine. Slowly drizzle in the warm
butter or ghee while mixing on low speed, until the sauce
emulsifies and thickens. If the sauce becomes too thick,
blend in a tablespoon of warm water.
3. SERVE the sauce immediately, or hold covered in a small
saucepan on the lowest heat setting for up to an hour.
Make your hollandaise fresh every time you serve it, as it
doesn’t store well in the refrigerator.


### IT’S IMPORTANT 
that your butter or ghee is warm but
not hot—if it’s too hot, the sauce could curdle. If you made
clarified butter with salted butter, skip the salt in this recipe.
You can always add a dash after tasting if it needs more.


## Notes

Most people think of hollandaise
as a topping for poached eggs (see
page 150), but it’s also great over
grilled fish, smoked salmon, and
vegetables like asparagus, green
beans, Brussels sprouts, and potatoes.
